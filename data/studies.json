      "abstract": "Copyright & Risk: Scoping the Wellcome Digital Library is a retrospective case study which aimed to assess the merits of the risk-managed approach to copyright clearance adopted by the Wellcome Library (WL) in the course of their pilot digitisation project Codebreakers: Makers of Modern Genetics. \n\nThe case study is based on semi-structured interviews, which were conducted with members of project staff at the Wellcome Library, and at their partner archive institutions. Project documentation was also made available, and this material takes two forms: policy documents which were circulated and updated as the project took place; and an internal report produced towards the end of the project, which includes a variety of statistics and more general lessons learned. \n\nThe report finds that while the initial risk management strategy adopted by the Wellcome has been successful, there is still very little evidence available about the success of rights clearance and risk management in the UK archive sector, and that further empirical investigation is required.",

In addition to this success, elements of the Wellcome Library approach to rights clearance could have wider applicability across the UK archive sector.\nThe Wellcome Library\u2019s risk management strategy had two broad aims: to manage the risks associated with publishing in-copyright material online and publishing potentially sensitive material online. They managed these risks in three ways.\nFirst: the publication of in-copyright material online was made possible using a risk management strategy which involves a set of risk criteria for identifying medium and high-risk rightsholders in the collections, and a diligent search standard for locating and contacting rightsholders.\nSecond: they managed the publication of potentially sensitive material online using their Access to Archives policy, which provides guidance that can be followed for all physical, digitised and born-digital material held across the Wellcome Library, to take into account both searchroom\nand online access to sensitive, personal data.\nThird: in addition to this, they have an established takedown policy which predates Codebreakers, and applies to all material available on their website. The most significant indicators of success for the archives clearance process include the number of permissions to publish granted: of the 77% of rightsholders contacted who responded, 98% said yes. The rate of response to permission requests itself was also relatively healthy compared to other projects: the Jon Cohen AIDS collection rights clearance project found that 68% of rightsholders contacted for permission to publish responded,127 compared to 77% in Codebreakers.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this research study is 1) to map the size of the public domain and frequency of its use; 2) analyse the role of public domain works in value creation for UK businesses; 3) assist creators and entrepreneurs to identify business models that benefit from the public domain. In addition to these outputs, the intellectual contribution of this project was to arrive at a sufficiently precise definition of the public domain to permit measurement of its value, and secondly, to critically appraise theories of creativity and innovation that explain how value might be generated from non-exclusive use of ideas and works available to all. The non-rival, non-excludable nature of the public domain would seem to limit its appeal to creators in a competitive market. Any observed commercial uptake of public domain material consequently raises important questions: What stimulates creators to invest in transforming or re-publishing public domain works? How do firms gain and sustain competitive advantage when exploiting freely available public domain materials? Finally, what policy options are available to promote market uptake of public domain materials, and what are the likely impacts?",

      "intervention_response": "The authors make three policy recommendations: \n\n*Assist communities in valorising the public domain; members of the public participate as both consumers and stakeholders in relation to the public domain. As much as possible, members of the public and stakeholder communities should be offered the opportunity to be involved in curating, preserving and disseminating public  domain materials. Ideally, outputs should be of professional quality and should be presented in formats which are machine-readable, manipulable, and adaptable to different mediums (to facilitate downstream use).\n\n*As far as possible, clarify legal status of public domain; Government should provide guidance on those issues, in a format that is accessible to creators and businesses.  Educational initiatives should be aimed at helping UK firms understand what is likely  to  be  still  in copyright and what is likely to be in the public domain.  Increasing the strategic capabilities of the UK media sector with respect to intellectual property will likely increase licensing of copyright works alongside uptake of public domain materials \u2013 both types of usage require similar legal awareness and capacity.  \n\n*Improve access to information; many respondents focused their concern on transaction costs, as searching for and using public domain materials was often more costly than licensing a less-suitable copyright work or hiring-in a replacement original work,  disinhibiting creation. Information about availability and access to public domain  works will help entrepreneurs make strategic decisions. Centralised databases of works with associated metadata, such as the Wikimedia Commons project, have sought to overcome such problems in limited, specific contexts. Initiatives to increase the  centralisation and searchability of public domain data will likely lower these barriers to entry and encourage innovation and new products.",

      "proposition": "Researchers identified the following issues relating to public domain uptake in Study 1:\n\n*Creators working with visual or multimedia content reported difficulties in  locating and securing high-quality sources of public domain works (image resolution, digital format). This was a significant challenge to commercialisation.\n\n*Archives, museums, and libraries were frequently cited as useful partners when seeking access to public domain works, able to provide access to source material and data needed to ascertain copyright status of work.\n\n*There was little concern about competition due to non-excludability of source material, but firms worried about costs of marketing and sustaining PD projects when initial development cost and investment was also low.\n\n*Clarity on legal use (e.g. requirements for \u2018diligent search\u2019 when using orphan  works) would improve commercialisation potential.\n\nThe main findings for Study 2 were as follows:\n\n*Use of both public domain and third party licensed material were significantly associated with higher likelihood of project success.\n\n*Influence of public domain status on success rate was most pronounced in the mediums of Comics and Theatre, compared with Publishing and Video Games. This suggests that the role of PD materials differs across mediums. Direct re-publication of public domain literature does not seem to be rewarded \u2013 aptation to another medium may be more attractive to backers. \n\n*Explicitly obtaining copyright permission to use a third party work in a Kickstarter pitch was significantly associated with higher funding levels achieved.\n\n*Previous experience and status of pitch creator was also significant to project success, suggesting that familiarity of both underlying work and its creator is important to Kickstarter funders.\n\nStudy 3 found: \n\n*Public domain availability makes a significant difference to inclusion of images on Wikipedia. Biographies for notable authors born prior to 1880 have a greater likelihood of containing an image than those born more recently, even though camera  technology became widespread in the 20th Century. Less than 58% of authors in the sample born after 1880 have images associated with their Wikipedia pages.  \n\n*Controlling for notoriety of authors, composers and lyricists using a  matched-pairs technique, we found that pages with public domain images attracted between 17% and  19% more visitors than pages where no image was available, reflecting the value those images contribute to the Wikipedia resource.\n\n*Using commercially equivalent licence fees obtained from Corbis and Getty for images relating to the biographical sample, we estimate a total value of USD $208 million (GBP \u00a3138million) per year for the 1,983,609 English-language Wikipedia pages in appropriate categories which contain public domain images.",

      "abstract": "This study measures the extent to which P2P file-sharing activities act as substitutes or complements to music purchases in markets for CDs. The paper breaks with the mainstream economics approach which dominates the music file-sharing discussion. Whereas such models assume relationships at the micro level (e.g. between file-sharing and purchases) based on observations made at the macro level, our evolutionary economics approach measures the direct effects using micro data representative of the Canadian population. The behavioral incentives underpinning free music downloading, novel to this paper, are the multiple effects of: \u2018unwillingness to pay\u2019 (market substitution), \u2018hear before buying\u2019 (market creation), \u2018not wanting to buy a whole album\u2019 (market segmentation), and \u2018not available in the CD format or on electronic pay-sites\u2019 (market creation). Although the two first mentioned incentives significantly influence CD album purchases\u2014i.e. there is a negative and significant market substitution effect and a positive and significant market creation effect\u2014on the whole, these two effects \u2018cancel\u2019 one another out, leading to no association between the number of P2P files downloaded and CD album sales.",

      "abstract": "Computer crime has increased exponentially in recent years as hardware, software, and network resources become more affordable and available to individuals from all walks of life. Software piracy is one prevalent type of cybercrime and has detrimentally affected the economic health of the software industry. Moreover, piracy arguably represents a rend in the moral fabric associated with the respect of intellectual property and reduces the financial incentive of product creation and innovation. Deindividuation theory, originating from the field of social psychology, argues that individuals are extricated from responsibility for their actions simply because they no longer have an acute awareness of the identity of self and of others. That is, external and internal constraints that would typically regulate questionable behavior are rendered less effective via certain anonymizing and disinhibiting conditions of the social and environmental context. This exploratory piece seeks to establish the role of deindividuation in liberating individuals to commit software piracy by testing the hypothesis that persons who prefer the anonymity and pseudonymity associated with interaction on the Internet are more likely to pirate software. Through this research, it is hoped that the empirical identification of such a social psychological determinant will help further illuminate the phenomenon.",

The contribution of knowledge capital not protected by IPRs is around 10.3%, slightly less than that of protected IPRs.\n\n* We view our results as a lower bound of the total contribution of IPR-protected assets.

      "abstract": "This study empirically examines Chinese computer users\u2019 ethical ideology and its relationship to their software piracy attitude and behaviour. The investigation reveals several important findings. First, cluster analysis results show that Chinese computer users can be divided into four ethical ideology types(i.e., situationists, absolutists, subjectivists, and exceptionists) reasonably consistent with Forsyth\u2019s taxonomy. Second, when compared with situationists, absolutists, and exceptionists, subjectivists are found to have the least unfavourable attitude towards software piracy and are most frequently engaged in software piracy. Third, Chinese computer users\u2019 ideological relativism exerts a stronger influence on their software piracy attitude and behaviour than does their ideological idealism. The findings suggest that the government, and authentic software developers and vendors should focus on subjectivists as their target audience of anti-software piracy communications. These policy makers and practitioners should also make concerted efforts to help subjectivists better realise how their software piracy act may damage parties \u2018proximate\u2019 to themselves so as to lower the rate of software piracy.",

The psychological determinants of music piracy behaviour were modeled in part with (1991) Ajzen\u2019s theory of planned behaviour. The results show that the intention to swap music on-line depended on one\u2019s attitude toward music piracy, one\u2019s perception that important others want that this behaviour be performed, and one\u2019s perceived competency in doing so. In addition, having swapped music on-line in the past had a strong influence on one\u2019s intention to do it again. Contrary to expectations, the anti-piracy arguments had no significant impact on the behavioural dynamics underlying on-line music piracy.",

      "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The exchange of goods between individual consumers being facilitated by the internet and \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d (P2P) systems is severely altering the business landscape. In broader terms, P2P exchanges are a form of what has occasionally been labeled \u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d (C2C) exchange. What little work there is in business research which has examined both C2C and P2P exchange has to-date been largely anecdotal or conceptual. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 A model of antecedents germane to the P2P phenomenon is formulated and empirically tested which includes the consumer\u2019s satisfaction with, extent of usage of, and future behavioral intentions toward P2P exchanges as the focal endogenous constructs of interest.\nFindings \u2013 The model is tested with perceptual and archival data from a survey of consumers active in one prevalent form of P2P exchange (i.e. the \u201cswapping\u201d of pirated music). The model explains significant variance in all three focal endogenous constructs.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 The primary limitations include the study\u2019s exploratory nature and not being able to incorporate all potentially salient constructs and variables germane to the P2P phenomenon within the context of the study reported here. Additionally, and from a sampling perspective, a more heterogeneous sample may benefit future research.\nPractical implications \u2013 The key insight emerging from the work is that the wide prevalence of P2P exchanges occurring globally between consumers has more to do with unexplored aspects of the phenomenon (such as its convenience; the \u201cconnectedness\u201d it makes consumers feel to others) and seemingly much less to do with traditional marketing mix variables.\nOriginality/value \u2013 While much has been written in the practitioner ranks and popular press about the problem of P2P exchanges, this work represents one of the first empirical studies of the antecedent drivers of the phenomenon. As is articulated in the paper\u2019s concluding sections, from a more embracing frame of reference, P2P systems and \u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d exchanges are not the dire threats many marketing managers believe them to be. Challenges remain, however, for marketers to determine how to best harness these powerful new systems.",

      "abstract": "Piracy is one of the most challenging problems faced by the motion picture industry. The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that US studios lose more than $3 billion annually in box office revenue from piracy. They have launched a major effort to prevent these losses. Yet their efforts are hampered by the ex post, counterfactual, and indirect methods by which losses are usually estimated. This paper addresses these issues directly. We develop and estimate a statistical model of the effects of piracy on the box-office performance of a widely-released movie. The model discredits the argument that piracy increases sales, showing unambiguously that Internet piracy diminished the box-office revenues of a widely released motion picture. The model overcomes a major weakness of counterfactual or \u201cbut for piracy\u201d methods widely used to estimate damages. These counterfactual methods violate the \u201cnobody knows\u201d principle because they forecast what the movie would have earned in the absence piracy. The model we present does not violate this basic principle of motion picture uncertainty. We estimate that pre-release and contemporaneous Internet downloads of a major studio movie accelerated its box-office revenue decline and caused the picture to lose about $40 million in revenue.",

      "abstract": "For decades, U.S. domestic and foreign IP policy has been predicated on the assumption that U.S. firms dominated both domestic and foreign markets for IP products. In an effort to evaluate the standing of U.S. firms in IP intensive industries, this paper identifies the \u201cnationality\u201d of the leading firms in several important IP industries. The paper finds that for many industries, this assumption of U.S. dominance is no longer correct. This suggests that at times, IP policies adopted by Congress and the Executive Branch may benefit foreign corporations at the expense of U.S. consumers.\nThere is absolutely nothing sinister about foreign ownership of firms in IP intensive industries, including foreign ownership of companies originally established in the U.S. This is to be expected in a globalized economy with multinational corporations and complex cross-border supply chains. Moreover, many countries in Western Europe and East Asia are at the same level of technological and economic development as the United States. The critical point is that in such a globalized economy, U.S policymakers should no longer assume without reflection that the beneficiaries of protectionist IP policies are U.S. firms and, by extension, U.S. workers and shareholders.",

As a result, \u201cDigital Natives\u201d\u2014young people growing up in the digital world with access to the technologies and the skills to use them in sophisticated ways\u2014are now confronting copyright law on a regular basis. This article presents qualitative research conducted with students age 12\u201322 that explores youth understanding, attitudes, and discourse on the topic of digital creativity and copyright law. Our findings suggest that young people operate in the digital realm overwhelmingly ignorant of the rights, and to a lesser degree the restrictions, established in copyright law. They often engage in unlawful behavior, such as illegal peer-to-peer music downloading, yet they nevertheless demonstrate an interest in the rights and livelihoods of creators. Building upon our findings of the disconnect between technical, legal, and social norms as pertaining to copyright law, we present the initial stages of the development of an educational intervention that posits students as creators: the Creative Rights copyright curriculum. Educating youth about copyright law is important for empowering young people as actors in society, both in terms of their ability to contribute to cultural knowledge with creative practices and to engage with the laws that govern society.",

      "abstract": "This Article is the first to use the copyright publication doctrine to clarify whether art, photographs, films, and historical documents that fill our museums and libraries are in the public domain. Knowing whether a photo, painting, film, or original letter was published is critically important to anyone who wants to use it today. Before 1989, publishing a work with no copyright notice dedicated the work to the public domain. Unpublished works without a notice are likely protected by copyright, and their unauthorized use can result in severe federal penalties. Unfortunately, the meaning of \u201cpublication\u201d in copyright law is notoriously ambiguous. The federal statutory definition suggests that works \u201cmade available\u201d to the public are published, while leading treatises generally assume that works given to public museums and libraries are unpublished. Confronted with this uncertainty, risk averse institutions too often assume that archived works are protected by copyright. Misunderstanding the law can keep cultural treasures locked in dark archives, vaults and basements, preventing their use as a foundation for new expression and distorting our sense of history.\n\nThis Article critically examines mistaken assumptions about copyright publication. It finds that neither the statutory definition nor leading treatises adequately identify when a work is published. A better standard for determining when a work is published and in the public domain is needed to free works from being locked up by copyright uncertainty. The best solution would clarify the boundaries of a stable public domain. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court took a wrong turn in dismissing the importance of the public domain. Knowing what content may be freely used is critical to preserving First Amendment values and freeing cultural treasures from copyright\u2019s bondage. The copyright ambiguity of archived works should be resolved in a way that honors the expressive and historical value of the public domain. After considering several alternatives, this Article shows how precedential patterns point to the best solution to the publication ambiguity. Drawing on empirical analysis of federal cases interpreting copyright publication, I identify the variables that are most important in determining whether archived works are published. The suggested solution focuses on copyright owner intent and the availability of authorized copies. Other factors described as significant in leading treatises \u2014 such as the type of work or archive \u2014 actually mask these two fundamental inquiries. The proposed standard provides a much needed solution to clarify which pieces of our cultural heritage are in the public domain and freely available as raw materials for educational sharing, expressive work, historical research, and public discourse.",

      "abstract": "Ever since the introduction of Napster, the impact of file sharing on the music industry has been the focus of intense debate. The availability of songs on file sharing networks has two competing effects on sales that are likely to vary across artists.\nFirst, there is a direct substitution effect on sales as some consumers download rather\nthan purchase music. Second, there is a penetration effect which increases sales, as the spread of an artist\u2019s works helps to make the artist more well-known throughout the population. The first effect is strongest for ex ante well-known artists, while the second is strongest for ex ante unknown artists. Thus file sharing reduces sales for well-known artists relative to unknown artists. Taking account of this heterogeneity in estimating the effect of file sharing provides strong evidence of this distributional effect. Additionally, I find a large aggregate negative effect on sales not apparent in previous work that failed to account for the differential impacts on more and less wellknown artists. The overall negative impact of file sharing arises because aggregate sales are dominated by sales of well-known artists. Using my estimates of the effect of file sharing, counterfactual exercises suggest that the lawsuits brought by the RIAA have resulted in an increase in album sales of approximately 2.9% during the 23 week period after the lawsuit strategy was publicly announced. Furthermore, if files available on-line were reduced across the board by 30%, industry sales would have been approximately 10% higher in 2003.",

Consequently, the enforcement of intellectual property rights is among the primary concerns of software publishers, music labels, movie studios, and other producers within industries affected by piracy. Developers of information-based products have appealed to various national governments and international organizations for assistance in clearly defining and enforcing intellectual property rights at both national and international levels.

      "abstract": "Conventional wisdom suggests that copyright piracy may in effect reduce the deadweight loss resulting from copyright protection because it allows the public unlimited access to information goods at a price closer to marginal cost. It has been further contended that lower copyright protection would benefit the society as a whole, as long as authors continue to receive sufficient incentives from alternative revenue streams in any ancillary markets, e.g. touring, advertising and merchandizing. By evaluating the empirical evidence from the music, performance and videogame markets, this article highlights a counterintuitive yet important point: Copyright piracy, while decreasing the deadweight loss in the music market, could simultaneously increase the deadweight loss in ancillary markets via the interaction between complementary goods. The deadweight loss in ancillary markets tends to become dominant if a substantial portion of relevant consumers have high valuation but low frequency in music consumption, are risk averse towards upfront payment with uncertain demand, and/or discount future value at a high rate. Additionally, the findings shed new lights on the current debates on several competing propositions to reform indirect copyright liabilities in the digital.",

      "abstract": "This report is the result of study that was performed in January and February 2009. It was presented and reviewed at the Annual Meeting of the Law and Society Association: Law, Power, and Inequality in the 21st Century in May 2009. The study empirically examined, or rather examined the lack of, social norms opposing illegal file sharing. A total of over 1,000 respondents have answered the questionnaire. Along with the social norm indicators, the study maps out relevant questions regarding internet behaviour in this field, such as the will to use anonymity services and the will to pay for copyrighted content. These results are compared and contrasted with the legal development trend in European law in internet and file sharing related matters, as well as the Swedish implementation of this development, as a member of the European Union. This includes the Intellectual Property Enforcement Directive (IPRED), the Directive on Data retention as well as the implementation of INFOSOC. Svensson and Larsson in Social Norms and Intellectual Property \u2013 Online norms and the European legal development consequently portrays the social norms on the one hand and the legal development on the other, and the overarching question of the report therefore addresses the correlation of these two. Do the social norms amongst 15-25 year olds match the legal regulation, as well as the regulatory trend on this field? If not, how can this be understood or explained? The study shows that the cybernorms differ, both in inherent structures and origin, from current legal constructions.",

      "abstract": "Digitization has impacted firm profitability in many media industries by lowering the cost of copying and sharing creative works. I examine the impact of digital rights management (DRM) - a prevalent strategy used by firms in media industries to address piracy concerns - on music sales. I exploit a natural experiment, where different labels remove DRM from their entire catalogue of music at different times, to examine whether relaxing an album's sharing restrictions increases sales. Using a large sample of albums from all four major record labels, I find that removing DRM increases digital music sales by 10% but relaxing sharing restrictions does not impact all albums equally. It increases the sales of lower-selling albums (i.e., the \"long tail\") significantly (30%) but does not benefit top-selling albums. These results suggest that the optimal strength of copyright depends on the distribution of products in firms' portfolio.",

Consequently, the higher the standard of living, the higher the individualism, and the higher the level of ICT expenditure in an economy, the lower the piracy rate. \n* Because the results were significant and consistent across the six years of the survey, they results are generalizable: ICT has a strong explanatory power to alleviate piracy. Accordingly, increases in ICT have a powerful effect to reducing a country\u2019s piracy rate.\n* This research confirms prior research that income per capita is the most influential factor on software piracy: a one thousand dollar increase in GNI per capita leads to the decrease in the piracy rate from between 0.6 and 1.01 percentage points. This variable alone explains between 59% and 74% of the variations in the rate of piracy across countries. \n* The inclusion of individualism alongside GNI per capita increased the explanatory power of the model by between 4 and 10%: a one unit rise in IDV index results in at least 0.194 percentage point fall in the piracy rate. This confirms previous findings that culture is a complementary factor that impacts software piracy, but perhaps a secondary factor compared to GNI.\n* A one percentage rise in ICT/GNI reduces the incidence of piracy by at least a 1.734 percentage point.

      "abstract": "Opening up public sector information (PSI) for re-use brings major socioeconomic benefits. Data generated by the public sector can be used as raw material for innovative value-added services and products which boost the economy by creating new jobs and encouraging investment in data-driven sectors. They also play a role in increasing government accountability and transparency. These benefits have recently been recognised by the G8 leaders and enshrined in an Open Data Charter.\n\nYet, studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission show that industry and citizens still face difficul ties in finding and re-using it. In response, in December 2011 the Commission adopted a package of measures (2) to overcome barriers to re-use and reduce the fragmentation of data markets. The key element was the recently adopted Directive 2013/37/EU amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information.\n\nThe amended Directive calls on the Commission to help the Member States implement the new rules by issuing guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re-use of documents. The guide lines are an important element of the Commission\u2019s efforts to help the EU\u2019s economy to generate more value from data (including scientific data and \u2018big data\u2019 from other sources than the public sector). They will also facilitate the roll-out of open data infrastructures under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\n\nIn August 2013, the Commission launched an online consultation followed by a public hearing and a meeting of a Member States expert group on PSI. The aim was to gather the views of all interested parties on the scope and content of the future Commission guidelines.  The purpose of this Commission Notice is to provide non-binding guidance on the best practices within the three subject areas of particular relevance for the re-use of public sector information in Europe.",

      "abstract": "Software piracy, the illegal and unauthorized duplication, sale, or distribution of software, is a widespread and costly phenomenon. According to Business Software Alliance (2008), over 41% of the PC software packages installed worldwide were unauthorized copies. Software piracy behavior has been investigated for more than 30 years. However, after a review of the relevant literature, there appears to be two voids in this literature: a lack of studies in non-Western countries and a scarcity of process studies. This study contributes to literature by developing a software piracy model to better understand the decision-making process that underlies this unethical behavior. The model was tested using data collected from a sample of 323 undergraduate business students. Consistent with the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), attitudes toward software piracy and subjective norms were significant predictors of intention to pirate software. Also, the results suggested that ethical ideology, public self-consciousness, and low self-control moderated the effect of these variables on intention to pirate software. The results have important practical implications for the software industry and governments hoping to curtail software piracy. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future studies are discussed as well.",

Through media, workshops or group discussion, students should be shown that software piracy norms among students are exaggerated;\n\n* An intervention program might indicate that there are a substantial portion of significant others who disapprove of software piracy behaviour;\n\n* The intervention program might reveal the identities of software pirates to the public through the media and the campus newspaper;\n\n* Presenting students with new information that associates software piracy with negative consequences such as lost taxes, higher software prices, and lost jobs should lead to these individuals forming new beliefs and developing a negative attitude toward software piracy.",

TRA posits that the most immediate precursor of behaviour is an individual\u2019s intention to behave, which in turn is determined by attitude toward a target behaviour and subjective norms. Subjective norms are perceived social pressures exerted on an individual to perform a behaviour or not. The results of the study were as follows:\n\n* TRA was a useful theoretical framework to predict Jordanian university students\u2019 intentions to engage in software piracy and explained variance in the individual\u2019s intention to pirate software;\n\n* Relative to attitude, subjective norms had a stronger effect on intention to pirate software;\n\n* The influence of perceived subjective norms on intention to pirate software was about twice as great as that of attitude toward software piracy;\n\n* The stronger effect of subjective norms in shaping Jordanian university students intention to pirate software relative to their attitudes might be attributed to the collectivistic nature of the Jordan culture;\n\n* The effect of students\u2019 attitude on their intention to pirate software was significantly moderated by ethical ideology (idealism and relativism);\n\n* The presence of low self-control enhanced the effect of subjective norms on behavioral intention. This suggests that low self-control students had stronger intentions to pirate software when they perceived that significant others were supportive of or engaged in such behaviour and vice versa;\n\n* High public self- consciousness students were more attuned to significant others\u2019 demands and opinions than students with low public self-consciousness; thus, their intentions to pirate software were determined more by their perception of subjective norms;\n\n* Religiosity had insignificant moderating effect on the software piracy attitude\u2013 intention relationship;\n\n* Subjective norms did not affect all students equally; subjective norms had a stronger effect on students who scored higher on low self-control and public self-consciousness scales;\n\n* The effect of attitude on intention to pirate software was significantly moderated by ethical ideology.",

Theoretically, however, piracy may raise legitimate demand through positive demand-side externalities, sampling, and sharing. Accordingly, the actual impact of piracy on the legitimate demand is an empirical issue. Addressing this issue in the context of recorded music, we develop and test hypotheses from theoretical models of end-user and re-seller piracy on international panel data for music CDs. Empirically, we find that the demand for music CDs decreased with piracy, suggesting that \"theft\" outweighed the \"positive\" effects of piracy. However, the impact of piracy on CD sales was considerably smaller than industry estimates. Further, we estimated that, accounting for both demand losses and price adjustments, the industry lost no more than 6.6% of revenue to piracy.",

Even if such positive effects did exist, they were more than offset by the harm caused by the loss in sales due to \u201ctheft\u201d.\n\n*The data set further allowed the authors to investigate in detail the presence of an indirect network effect, by which higher piracy increases the ownership of CD players, which in turn stimulates the demand for legitimate music CDs. \n\n*The results showed that the demand for legitimate music CDs was indeed positively associated with higher CD player ownership. However, the correlation between the pirated quantity and CD player ownership was quite modest, and not statistically significant. Pirated music did not have a significant complementary effect on the demand for CD players, and hence it might not have contributed to the raising legitimate demand through an indirect network effect.\n\n*The authors estimated that piracy caused legitimate sales to fall by 0.0954 unit per capita.

      "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of music file sharing on CD purchases. Traditionally, two arguments are opposed concerning the impact of music file sharing on CD sales. On the one hand, MP3 downloads only reduces sales of legitimate CDs (the \"competition effect\"). On the other hand, consumption of free MP3s could lead people to buy CD which they would never have bought otherwise (the \u201csampling effect\u201d). Because the court in the Napster case and some academic researchers have dismissed this sampling effect, this article seeks to assess whether sampling does indeed occur and in the affirmative what are the relative contributions of the positive sampling and the negative competition effects of MP3 files on CD purchases. To do so, we administered an anonymous online survey in two French graduate schools from May 26 to June 3, 2004. We find that there are two populations: explorers and pirates. For the explorers, MP3 downloading from P2P networks has a positive impact on CD consumption. For the pirates, anonymous file-sharing on the internet and intranets has a negative effect on CD consumption, while physical exchanges have a positive effect.",

Consistent with other studies, we find that intellectual property receives greater protection in developed economies; high-income countries have lower piracy rates. We also find that protection depends on cultural factors. Countries with an individualist culture have lower piracy rates than do countries with a collectivist culture. Piracy rates are also lower in countries that have strong institutions that enforce contracts and protect property from expropriation.

Second, the results indicate the important link between economic institutions and intellectual property. Countries that protect contracts and traditional property also tend to be ones that protect intellectual property to software. Third, they indicate that the positive correlation between economic development and protection of intellectual property (i.e. low piracy rates) need not be casual. Although the exact relationship between economic development and intellectual property protection is unclear, it appears that much of the positive correlation can be explained by cultural and institutional factors that are correlated with economic development. \nTaken together these results suggest that efforts to reform intellectual property rights around the world must be sensitive to differences in cultural traditions and economic institutions, as well as differences in economic development.",

      "abstract": "The U.S. tattoo industry generates billions of dollars in annual revenue. Like the music, film, and publishing industries, it derives value from the creation of new, original works of authorship. But unlike rights holders in those more traditional creative industries, tattoo artists rarely assert formal legal rights in disputes over copying or ownership of the works they create. Instead, tattooing is governed by a set of nuanced, overlapping, and occasionally contradictory social norms enforced through informal sanctions. And in contrast to other creative communities that rely on social norms because of the unavailability of formal intellectual property protection, the tattoo industry opts for self-governance despite the comfortable fit of its creative output within the protections of the Copyright Act.\nThis Article relies on qualitative interview data drawn from more than a dozen face-to-face conversations with professionals in the tattoo industry. Based on those interviews, it offers a descriptive account of the social norms that have effectively displaced formal law within the tattoo community, provides a set of complementary cultural and economic explanations for the development of those norms, and outlines the broader implications of this research for intellectual property law and policy.",

Perhaps then, it is not entirely surprising that they have opted to regulate this unique form of expression with rules crafted and enforced within their community.\n\n* The norms tattooers have developed serve a number of overlapping purposes. They protect both the relationship between tattooer and client and the underlying assertion of personal sovereignty the tattoo represents by guaranteeing client autonomy.\n\n* The value of these norms is not confined to tattooers and their clients. They offer the rest of us something as well. They demonstrate that the assumptions upon which we base intellectual property law are empirically untested and myopically focused on a tiny sliver of overall creative production defined by legacy business models.",

Specifically, both demographic effects and product quality levels differ across the VHS and DVD formats and contribute to the different pricing strategies chosen for these two formats. However, the most important difference for explaining firms\u2019 pricing decisions seems to be the relative value of owning a movie, which varies by movie and also by format.Welfare effects of the current price discrimination strategies used by firms in the United States is also examined and found that indirect price discrimination benefits copyright holders but generally harms retailers. Consumer welfare is highest under the current price discrimination strategies in use; thus, for some titles, indirect price discrimination benefits consumers, while for other titles, consumers are made worse off by this form of price discrimination.Welfare effects of an alternative form of copyright protection is also estimated that would allow for direct price discrimination, and found that price discrimination under this law tends to benefit copyright holders and consumers at the expense of retailers.",

      "abstract": "As software piracy continues to be a threat to the growth of national and global economies, understanding why people continue to use pirated software and learning how to discourage the use of pirated software are urgent and important issues. In addition to applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB) perspective to capture behavioral intention to use pirated software, this paper considers perceived risk as a salient belief influencing attitude and intention toward using pirated software. Four perceived risk components related to the use of pirated software (performance, social, prosecution and psychological risks) have been identified, measured and tested. Data were collected through an online survey of 305 participants. The results indicate that perceived prosecution risk has an impact on intention to use pirated software, and perceived psychological risk is a strong predictor of attitude toward using pirated software. In addition, attitude and perceived behavior control contribute significantly to the intended use of pirated software. However, the proposed direct relationship between subjective norm and intention to use pirated software is not supported. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

      "abstract": "From a utilitarian perspective, devising an optimal copyright regime requires a simple\nbalancing of copyright\u2019s benefits against its costs in order to maximize the resulting social welfare. While simple in theory, this balance has proven surprisingly difficult to achieve in practice. In part, this difficulty arises because the data available is inevitably limited, and often observational, and so the conclusions are fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty. In part, it arises because there are vested political interests that do not want an optimal copyright regime. Rather, they seek a copyright regime that maximizes their own welfare, whatever that may be.As a result, whatever data is available, and whatever uncertainty or ambiguity remains, they will twist in order to ensure that copyright serves them, rather than society as a whole. Whether due to the first problem or the second, there are also surprisingly few empirical studies of the costs and benefits associated with broadening or narrowing copyright. This study aims to help fill that gap by examining how file sharing has affected the creation and dissemination of new original\nmusic.",

First, it shifted output along the music-other margin and led to fewer new artists, as some individuals, given the lower returns available in music, decided to devote their time and creativity elsewhere. Second, it shifted output along the work-leisure margin and led to more new music from existing artists, as the lower returns led existing artists to substitute work for leisure.

      "abstract": "The popularity of online music-sharing networks has attracted interest from the music industry, artists, consumer advocacy groups, the popular press, and government legislative and regulatory entities. P2P networks have become lightning rods for debates on intellectual property rights and music market fates. Yet, to date, little has been based on actual observed activity on online sharing networks. Here we report on an initial P2P network data gathering and analysis endeavor and relate it to market performance of music albums. The relative market performance of music albums is gauged using the list of top 100 albums on the weekly Billboard charts. The P2P sharing data gathered is longitudinal, spanning a period of 8 weeks. We also identify and track data for 47 upcoming album releases providing pre- and post-release comparisons of sharing activity. We offer four main findings:\n(1) significant piracy opportunity and activity were observed;\n(2) the level of sharing opportunities are related to albums' relative chart positions;\n(3) there is evidence of both \u201cpre-purchase sampling\u201d piracy and \u201clost-sales\u201d piracy; and,\n(4) sharing activity levels provide leading indicators of direction of movement of albums on the Billboard charts.\nPoints (3) and (4) have particular implications for music marketing and promotion.",

Based on a survey of 552 college students, results revealed that students who believed that illegal downloading would help save money and was convenient and those who did not want to be termed as being afraid of risk were more likely to download illegally, whereas those who had illegality concerns and high moral standards were less likely to download illegally. In addition, perceived social approval for downloading, but not the perceived frequency of others\u2019 downloading behaviors, predicted intentions to download.

Yet, despite this importance, there is very little work on the topic in the \neconomics literature. In this paper, we consider the effect of incentives on creativity. We present\na first series of experiments on individual creativity where subjects face creativity tasks where, in \none case, ex-ante goals and constraints are imposed on their answers, and in the other case no \nrestrictions apply. The effects of financial incentives in stimulating creativity in both types of \ntasks is then tested, together with the impact of personal features like risk and ambiguity \naversion. Our findings show that, in general, financial incentives affect \u201cclosed\u201d (constrained)\ncreativity, but do not facilitate \u201copen\u201d (unconstrained) creativity. However, in the latter case \nincentives do play a role for ambiguity-averse agents, who tend to be significantly less creative \nand seem to need extrinsic motivation to exert effort in a task whose odds of success they don\u2019t \nknow. The second set of experiments aims at exploring group creativity in contexts where the \n\u201ccorporate culture\u201d is either cooperative or individualistic. Our results show that, in the case of closed tasks, financial incentives and collectivist attitudes foster creativity, but only with\ncooperative corporate culture.",

The norm of anti-piracy, the ideology of free software, the norm of reciprocity, and the ideology of consumer rights are proposed as four deontological norms related to using P2P systems. The model is tested using a scenario survey with four alternatives; the results indicate that the deontological norm of anti-piracy is not a main factor in affecting P2P users\u2019 ethical considerations regarding sharing files with others.

Consumer rights may be the major and general cause for sharing music files in the P2P network.\n\n*The norm of reciprocity and the ideology of freeware can also motive people to use a free P2P system to sharing music files, but their using free P2P systems is discouraged by their belief in the norm of anti-piracy.\n\n*There are several reasons for the weak impact of the belief in the norm of anti-piracy. First, paying the P2P provider may transfer guilt and the problem of piracy to the P2P system provider. People may believe they are doing a good thing for both musicians and consumers by distributing good music, instead of hurting copyright holders. The large numbers on a P2P network and the anonymity of a computer-mediated environment may also create ethical ambiguity and lead to deindividuation. This leads to the negative effects of decreasing self- awareness and stimulating anti-normative behavior.\n\n*The Hunt\u2013Vitell model suggests that when behavior and intentions are inconsistent with ethical judgments, one of the consequences will be guilt (Hunt and Vitell, 1986). Unethical behavior, however, like other behaviors, is learned in social interaction. People learn the techniques of neutralization, which is a set of justifications or rationalizations that can insulate people from self-blame when they engage in norm-violating behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The current article attempts to refine and specify a model based on other researchers' applications of the Social Cognitive Theory originally posited by Bandura to allow the behaviour and attitudes downloaders exhibit to be analysed and compared to the amount of movies they consume (measured as an monthly average estimate). The new model is then tested against data obtained from college students as well as from a technological lifestyle forum. After the revisions these analyses suggested were applied, the model explained nearly 23% of the variance in the number of movies downloaded. The most important factors in this model were, among others: the drives to see many different and new movies, the social environment and its perceived attitude toward the behaviour, and the degree to which downloading has embedded itself in the daily routine. Because the Dutch government and lobbyists are superficially unclear about the current legislature, the unique opportunity existed to study the impact of knowing about legislature on the behaviour. Other results indicate an unexpected openness to an alternative film-distribution method where both the producers and the consumers get an honest deal, presenting options to release the current political and social tension without prosecuting an increasing portion of the population.",

      "abstract": "The argument that the Federal Circuit is an insular court lacking in intellectual curiosity has invaded academic discourse about the court and its jurisprudence. It is rarely used as a compliment. It is rather used as an epithetic description intended to have broad explanatory power for nearly any of the many and glaring limitations that speakers and commentators contend exist in the court\u2019s body of law. The empirical basis for the argument comes from a single finding: that between 1996 and 2000 the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals referenced legal scholarship in their decisions in trademark and copyright cases nearly four times as often as the Federal Circuit referenced legal scholarship in its decisions in patent cases. While scholars and others have relied upon this finding to assert that the Federal Circuit\u2019s performance is intellectually deficient, there are reasons to question whether that inference is proper. For instance, it stands in contrast to other observations that suggest the Federal Circuit behaves a lot like the regional circuits when it comes to its relationship to legal scholarship. \n\nIn this study, we explore the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s use of legal scholarship in its patent, trademark, and copyright jurisprudence. We report evidence of striking differences in the use of scholarship that depend on whether a decision concerns patent, trademark, or copyright law. The Court uses scholarship in patent decisions at a rate of 28%, but uses it around twice as often in its copyright (67%) and trademark (53%) decisions. While, moreover, the rates at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its copyright and trademark decisions are some of the highest observed in the Court\u2019s entire jurisprudence, the rate at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its patent decisions is among the lowest observed. This Article discusses the significance of these observations to the empirical basis for the epithetic argument that the Federal Circuit is more insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity than other circuit courts of appeals.",

      "abstract": "This article describes practices of informal digital media circulation emerging in urban Cuba between 2005 and 2010, drawing from interviews and ethnographic research in the city of Santiago de Cuba. The Cuban new media landscape is supported by informal networks that blend financial and social exchanges to circulate goods, media, and currency in ways that are often illegal but are largely tolerated. Presenting two case studies of young, educated Cubans who rely on the circulation of film and television content via external hard drives for most of their media consumption, I suggest that the emphasis of much existing literature on the role of state censorship and control in Cuban new media policy overlook the everyday practices through which Cubans are regularly engaged with Latin and U.S. American popular culture. Further, informal economies have been central to everyday life in Cuba both during the height of the Soviet socialist era and in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union that has seen a juxtaposition of some market reforms alongside centrally planned policies. In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances. Understanding the informal media economy of Cuba within this broader context helps to explain how the consumption of commercial American media is largely uncontroversial within Cuban everyday life despite the fraught politics that often dominates discussions of Cuban media policy.",

      "abstract": "Illegal consumer file sharing of motion pictures is considered a major threat to the movie industry. Whereas industry advocates and some scholars postulate a cannibalistic effect on commercial forms of movie consumption, other researchers deny this effect, though sound evidence is lacking on both sides. Drawing on extant research and utility theory, the authors present hypotheses on the consequences and determinants of consumer file sharing and test them with data from a controlled longitudinal panel study of German consumers. The data contain information on the consumers' intentions toward and actual behavior in relation to the consumption of 25 new motion pictures, allowing the authors to study more than 10,000 individual file-sharing opportunities. The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of consumer file sharing. They find evidence of substantial cannibalization of theater visits, DVD rentals, and DVD purchases responsible for annual revenue losses of $300 million in Germany. Five categories of file-sharing behavior drive file sharing and have a significant impact on how consumers obtain and watch illegal movie copies.",

Business models may emerge that incorporate these concepts in part or in combination, and technology will continuously inform the practices of both licensors and licensees.

      "abstract": "The effective management of digital rights is the central challenge in many industries making the transition from physical to digital products. We present a new model that characterizes the value of these digital rights when products are sold both embedded in tangible physical artifacts, and as pure digital goods, and when granting rights permitted by one's digital rights management (DRM) platform may affect the extent of digital piracy. Our model indicates that in the absence of piracy, digital rights should be unrestricted, since a seller can use its pricing strategy to optimally balance sales between physical and digital goods. However, the threat of piracy limits the extent to which digital rights should be granted: the value of digital rights is determined not only by their direct effect on the quality of legal digital goods, but by a differential piracy effect that can lower a seller's pricing power. When the latter effect is sufficiently high, granting digital rights can have a detrimental effect on value - our model indicates that this kind of effect is more likely to be observed for digital rights that aim to replicate the consumption experience of physical goods, rather than enhancing a customer's digital experience. We test the predictions of our analytical model using data from the ebook industry. Our empirical evidence supports our theoretical results, showing that four separate digital rights each have an economically significant impact on ebook prices, and establishing that the digital rights which aim to replicate physical consumption while increasing the threat of piracy are the ones that have negative impact on seller value. We also show that if the pricing of a digital good is keyed off that of an existing tangible good, optimal pricing changes for the former should be more nuanced, rather than simply mirroring changes in the price of the latter, and we discuss the effect of the technological sophistication of potential customers on optimal pricing and rights management. Our results represent new evidence of the importance of an informed and judicious choice of the different digital rights granted by a DRM platform, and provide a new framework for guiding managers in industries that are progressively being digitized.",

However, a model of the simultaneous choice of tangible and digital pricing in the presence of piracy would be a useful extension, especially as digital goods gain prominence in more industries.\n\n*While most digital goods in other industries do not currently have the rich variation in rights across products that made our empirical study of ebook pricing viable, they are likely to in the near future, and may present the opportunity for studies similar to ours across other industries like music and broadcast video.

Any issues of cannibalization of the sales of physical goods can be effectively addressed by a strategic choice of pricing.\n\n*When granting digital rights in the presence of digital piracy, the value of these rights is governed by two opposing effects: a direct quality effect, or how much the granting of the right increases willingness to pay for the legal digital goods, and a differential piracy effect, which measures how much the digital right reduces the relative surplus of consuming legal tangible and digital goods through inducing digital piracy.\n\n*When the direct quality effect balances the differential piracy effect, then granting the right is beneficial to the seller. It raises prices and products from the sales of digital goods. This effect is more likely to be associated with rights that enhance the digital consumption experience of the good, rather than replicate the physical consumption experience, since consumers who purchase the digital good belong to the segment who value digital quality. If they valued the physical consumption experience, these consumers would have purchased the tangible good in the first place.\n\n*When the differential quality effect associated with a digital right exceeds the direct quality effect significantly, granting the right may affect the sellers pricing power adversely, since consumers who prefer digital goods over tangible goods need to be offered sufficient surplus to ensure that they do not simply resort to using a pirated copy of the good. This kind of right is generally likely to be one that attempts to replicate the physical consumption experience digitally. \n\n*In testing the theory\u2019s predictions using pricing and digital rights data for over 30,000 ebooks, each of four digital rights has both a statistically and economically significant impact on ebook prices, after controlling for tangible book price levels, sales rank and category. \n\n*Results also show that a right that aims to replicate physical consumption characteristics (printing) has a negative impact on ebook prices, while rights enhancing the consumption experience by exploiting the fact that the book is now a digital good (copying) have a positive impact on prices.\n \n*The variation in ebook prices observed across categories suggests that an increase in technological sophistication of consumers is associated with an increase in the price of legal digital goods.",

      "abstract": "The availability of digital distribution channels raises many new challenges for managers in the media industries. This is particularly true for movie studios where content can be stolen and released through illegitimate digital distribution channels before, or shortly after, the legitimate release date. In response to this potential threat, movie studios have spent millions of dollars attempting to protect their content from unauthorized release, to prosecute those who might distribute or consume pirated content, and to lobby governments to strengthen anti-piracy laws.\nHowever, surprisingly, there has been very little rigorous research to analyze whether,\nand how much, movie piracy cannibalizes legitimate sales. In this paper, we analyze\nthis question in the context of pre-release movie piracy. Using data collected from a\nunique Internet file-sharing site, we find that pre-release piracy significantly reduces a\nmovie\u2019s market potential, although movies with pre-release piracy exhibit a slower sales\ndecline over time. We estimate that the net effect of pre-release piracy is approximately\na 15% reduction in box office sales.\nOur study contributes to the growing literature on piracy and digital media consumption in the Information Systems community by presenting evidence of the impact of Internet-based movie piracy, by taking a pre-release perspective to strengthen causal inference, and by differentiating the effect of pre-release movie piracy from the other types of piracy that the extant literature has previously considered.",

Theoretically founded in the sociology of law, the study uses a well-defined concept of norms to quantitatively measure changes in the strength of social norms before and after the implementation of legislation.

A survey was conducted three months before the IPRED law came into force, and it was repeated six months later. The approximately one thousand respondents between fifteen and twenty-five years-of-age showed, among other things, that although actual file-sharing behaviour had to some extent decreased in frequency, social norms remained unaffected by the law.",

Given the generativity of the technologies of online communication in networks, these counter-measures may imply an increased diffusion of techniques of online anonymization. \n\n*This means that the legal enforcement of copyright not only risks undermining public confidence in the legal system in general, but also facilitates the diffusion of technological knowledge that will undermine legal enforcement in general when it comes to computer-mediated crime.",

Behavioural change sometimes leads to changes in the social norm structures, even when the former has occurred as a result of enforcement strategies.\n\n*The survey results show that one possible cause why people in common ignore copyright online is the lack of social norms that reinforce the legal framework. Generally, people observe informal social control, and when the law, as in this instance, lacks a social equivalent, there are only weak incentives for them to comply with it. \n\n*If implementation of IPRED in Swedish legislation on April 1 2009 was able to influence social norms, the effect was marginal; thus the pedagogical effect of the law does not come into play.\n\n*Considerably more respondents stated that they \ufffcnever file-share in Study 2 than is the case in Study 1. This means that the implementation of IPRED actually has had an effect on file sharing as such, but this is a purely deterrent effect rather than a change of social norms. \n\nThe study reports the following limitations:\n\n*Limitations inherent in the quantitative approach suggest a need for future qualitative research that complements the understanding of file sharing and legal compliance from a situated-cognitive perspective. This could include the impact of other factors such as the media\u2019s role in communicating legal revisions, or a more language and conceptual metaphor-based approach to copyright formulations and functions in comparison with a digitalized society \n\n*A follow up-study \ufffcof the same survey as in this study might prove useful in confirming, refuting or nuancing the long-time effects of IPRED\u2019s implementation that are suggested here.",

      "abstract": "There is a common perception that digitisation has prompted changes in creative labour markets. In particular, it is widely assumed that exploiters insist on \"grabbing rights\" (i.e. broadly conceived assignments of rights), that visual artists are not able to negotiate, that they are paid less and less, and that they are compelled to waive their moral rights.\nThis study suggests a much more equivocal picture. In place of a straightforward narrative of decline, the results of the survey suggest that in most fields there has been less change over the last decade than one might have expected: that, terms of exploitation are most often about the same. That is not to say that there are no discernible changes in particular occupations and media. Respondents and interviewees identify some important shifts. Perhaps surprisingly, it seems there are changes in practice that are, from the creator's perspective, both positive and negative. The most positive change is identified amongst the fine artists where half (50%) see their personal bargaining position as having improved, with only 6% perceiving a weakening. The most disturbing changes are in relation to photographers. About half of all photographers (49%) say their bargaining position has worsened, with only 22% reporting improvements. A significant percentage of photographers (40%) report an increase in assignments (compared with 6% who think they have decreased). Moreover, 24% report an increase in moral rights waivers (compared to 3% who identify a decrease), and a decline in the practice of attribution. 31% of photographers see attribution as decreasing over the last decade, and only 8% increasing. 28% say income from secondary use has decreased, while only 16% say it has decreased.",

Our results show that through on-line interactions, pirates learn the norms and values of digital piracy, including how to recognize and avoid risks associated with pirating and how to make sense of and justify their actions. They did not see themselves as members of a piracy subculture, however.

Technologies that rely on digital processing of entire copyrighted works, such as Internet search engines and plagiarism detection software, nonetheless present a very strong case for fair use.\n\n*There is no evidence that commercial use (in contrast to direct commercial use) reduces the defendant\u2019s chance of maintaining a fair use defense. \n\n*Regression analysis of the effect of party status variables on the probability of a finding of fair use either failed to find the predicted underdog effect or found exactly the opposite.\n\n*This study offers considerable evidence against the oft-repeated assertion that fair use adjudication is blighted by unpredictability and doctrinal incoherence.",

Ashcroft. We show that behavioral biases - namely, individuals' optimistic bias regarding their future longevity and their subadditive judgments in circumstances resembling the extant rule of copyright duration - explain the otherwise puzzling lifetime-plus-years basis for copyright protection given to individual authors, and reveal how this regime provides superior incentives to create. Thus, insofar as the provision of increased incentives to individual authors is socially desirable, a lifetime-plus-years rule is a more effective legal means of accomplishing this goal than a rule based on a fixed term of years of a comparable expected duration.",

      "abstract": "File sharing may substantially undermine the intellectual property rights of digital goods. This paper concentrates on the music industry. I estimate the effect of music downloads on the probability of purchasing music using a European individual-level\ncross section of 15,000 people from 2001. A simple comparison of means shows that people who regularly download music online are more likely to buy music. The positive relationship persists when controlling for observed characteristics. However, simultaneity between tastes for music and peer-to-peer usage makes it difficult to isolate the causal effect of music downloads on music purchases. To break that simultaneity, this paper uses measures of Internet sophistication and the speed of the Internet connection as instruments. The results suggest that peer-to-peer usage reduces the probability of buying music by 30 percent. On the basis of my estimates, back of the-envelope calculations indicate that-without downloads-sales in 2002 would have been around 7.8 percent higher.",

Frequent users are clearly more often male than female, are younger, and possess lower educational qualifications than infrequent users.

      "abstract": "This report examines data on the effects of Internet peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing activities on music purchasing which was obtained from a survey commissioned by Industry Canada. The survey was designed to inform Industry Canada's policy development work and ultimately therefore support better policy decisions regarding the copyright law in Canada. In order to support its policy decisions regarding the copyright regime in Canada, Industry Canada commissioned a survey by Decima Research in 2006 which was designed to measure the extent to which peer to peer (P2P) file-sharing activities act as substitutes or complements to music purchases. Given this purpose the Decima survey asked respondents to comment on their behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing, as follows:\n\nConsidering the songs that you downloaded for free through P2P networks during 2005\na) what % would you have purchased at paid music sites if they were not available through P2P\nb) what % would you have purchased as part of a music CD if they were not available through P2P\n\nAfter analyzing the answers to this question, I report on two key findings:\n1. three out of every four respondents said that if P2P were not available they would have purchased some or all of the music which they downloaded; and\n2. almost two-thirds of the hardcore P2P downloaders (those who indicated in the survey that they only acquired music by P2P) said they would have purchased one-third of the tracks they downloaded if the songs were not available on P2P network. This is estimated to amount to an average additional expense of $168 per person, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue for the music industry per year from this group alone.\n\nThis analysis of survey data then suggests that P2P downloads have strong negative effects on legitimate music purchases and that P2P downloading acts as a substitute for legitimate music purchases. One might reasonably infer from this analysis that stronger copyright laws would substantially increase music purchases and music industry sales revenues and, by implication, increase artist income, industry employment, economic growth and government tax revenues in Canada. My analysis not only focuses on an important survey question which to date has not been analysed by the researchers hired by Industry Canada, it also contradicts the results of the original analysis of the data commissioned by Industry Canada, first published on Industry Canada\u2019s website in a 2007 report entitled, \u201cDon\u2019t blame the P2P file-sharers: the impact of free music downloads on the purchase of music CDs in Canada\u201d, and then subsequently republished with changes by the authors in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics in 2010.",

      "abstract": "We examine the role of age, gender, and work experience on the propensity to buy, share, and use pirated software. These demographics are key properties of the cognitive-developmental, gender socialization, and occupational socialization theories. We find the overall level of reported buying is low, while the level of sharing and use is high. From the perspective of socialization, we find differences in levels of buying based on gender, differences in levels of sharing based on age and gender, and differences in levels of use based on years of work experience. This suggests the source of pirated software has shifted from buying to a diffusion network that involves sharing within certain social groups. The higher rate of use for those with more years of work experience reinforces a continual problem for software vendors: The inability of customers to pay for software that is deemed necessary to conduct business.",

The study provides a better sociological understanding of piracy behaviour and a person's propensity to engage in software piracy as follows:\n\n*  Sharing pirated software has twice the impact of buying, in that the diffusion of pirated software amongst a social group is less dependant on the purchase of a pirate disc and more upon the acquisition of a copy through friends, colleagues or peer to peer networks;\n\n* No form of socialisation (age, gender or work experience) can account for a propensity to engage in buying, sharing and using pirated software. Significant correlations are found relative to each single category however;\n\n* Younger people are more likely to share pirated software than older people; \n\n* Males tend to be the initiators (buyers) and females are the facilitators (sharers) of the software piracy diffusion network;\n\n* Number of years of work experience is the only socialisation variable to detect a difference in using pirate software. People with more work experience are more likely to use pirate software.",

      "abstract": "File sharing systems such as Napster and KaZaA are accused by the recording industry of causing declines in sales of music CDs, and recently users of these systems are under lawsuit attack. However, there is not sufficient evidence that file sharing systems are responsible for the recent decline in music CD sales. Two previous studies examined micro data of sales and downloads and found mixed results regarding the connection between file sharing and CD sales (Blackburn, 2004; Oberholzer and Strumpf, 2004).\n\nThe current essay estimated the effect of file sharing systems on music CD sales using micro data from Japan in 2004. Japan\u2019s file sharing system (\u201cWinny\u201d) is almost completely decentralized and highly anonymous compared with ones addressed in the two previous studies, thus Japanese users can download music files with less concern about lawsuits. The goal of this research is to examine the effect of file sharing on music CD sales in such an illegal-copy-friendly file sharing system.\n\nBased on micro data of CD sales and numbers of downloads, we found that there was very little evidence that file sharing reduces music CD sales in Japan. We controlled simultaneous bias between sales and downloads by instrumental variables, but did not find correlation between CD sales and numbers of downloads. Although there were large differences in the numbers of downloads among CD titles, these differences did not affect CD sales. We also carried out a user survey on file sharing and CD purchases with consideration to the potential bias of respondents trying to understate their illegal copying activity. This survey also showed that file sharing had very limited influence on CD purchases.",

I test if this holds empirically in the music industry using data from an exclusive file-sharing website that allows users to share music files using the BitTorrent protocol. These are the most reliable file-sharing data available because they are from a private tracker, which is an invitation-only file-sharing network. \n\nTo overcome the endogeneity of the number of downloads, I exploit variation in the availability of sound recordings in file-sharing networks to isolate the causal effect of file-sharing on music sales. The results strongly suggest that the aggregate effect of file-sharing is precisely estimated to be extremely small. The direction of the effect is positive but its magnitude indicates that file-sharing does not increase or decrease aggregate sales in the music industry. I conclude with an investigation of the distributional effects of file-sharing on sales and find that file-sharing benefits more established and popular artists at the expense of newer and smaller artists.

We then subtract this generic Internet impact from the overall Internet impact and conclude that the decline associated with that component of Internet use that we can attribute to file-sharing indicates that file-sharing has caused the entire decline in record sales and appears to have vitiated what otherwise would have been growth in the industry.

While this question is receiving considerable attention in academia, industry, and Congress, we are the first to study the phenomenon employing data on actual downloads of music files. We match an extensive sample of downloads to U.S. sales data for a large number of albums. To establish causality, we instrument for downloads using data on international school holidays. Downloads have an effect on sales that is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

Many communities use the same open-source software.\n\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 Only a small number of file sharers (three) were interviewed. However they provide rich insights into this under-researched topic.\n\nPractical implications \u2013 An understanding of these sophisticated underground file sharing communities assists the further development of legitimate online music systems to appeal to the large number of individuals involved in music file sharing communities.\n\nSocial implications \u2013 This paper provides an understanding of the practices within a subculture that is currently regarded as deviant and illegal, and contributes to the discussion and policy formulation on file sharing.\n\nOriginality/value \u2013 This study is the only known ethnography investigating underground music file sharing communities. These communities have not been systematically studied previously and the paper addresses this lack of research literature. This study is also novel as it applies actor-network theory to a context to which it has not previously been applied.",

      "abstract": "A growing empirical literature examines the relationship between music file sharing and legal purchases of music, but existing studies examine the period before consumers had attractive legal digital a la carte options. The iTunes Music Store has grown quickly since its appearance in 2003, and digital music now accounts for a third of US recorded music sales. Using two new surveys of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates in 2009 and 2010, we ask how music file sharing and sales displacement operate in the iTunes era, when the alternative to file sharing is purchasing individual songs, rather than entire albums. We find large amounts of file sharing in this population. Respondents have more stolen than paid music, but the music obtained via file sharing is, for the most part, low-valuation music which the respondents would likely not have purchased. The rate of sales displacement implied by the relationship between stolen and purchased music across respondents in both samples is between \u22120.15 and \u22120.3. That is, an additional song stolen reduces paid consumption by between a third and a sixth of song. Perhaps surprisingly, this is about the same as the CD sales displacement rate found for the pre-iTunes era using a similar empirical approach on a similar study population.",

In comparison with P2P supply, the current models of online delivery such as iTunes seem to suffer from a lack of cultural diversity.",

      "abstract": "In the past decade the entertainment industry has waged a legally very successful campaign against online copyright infringements. In a series of high profile decisions, content industries persuaded courts to accept expansive interpretations of contributory enforcement, to create novel doctrines of copyright infringement, and to apply broad interpretations of statutory damage provisions. Many private file-sharers, technology companies, university administrators and Internet service providers have felt the reach of this litigation effort. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: even as the copyright industry has ramped up the level of deterrence, online copyright infringements continue unabated.\n\nWhy has the legal battle against file-sharers been so ineffective? The most straightforward explanation is that infringers are not deterred, either because the probability of getting caught remains remote or because the sanctions are not sufficiently salient. If that is the case, the expansive statutory damage award remedies in recent decisions such as Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset and Sony BMG v. Tenebaum, carry renewed promise for the entertainment industry. \n\nIn this Article we claim that this deterrence-based approach will prove futile and even counterproductive to the goals of copyright holders. We argue that copyright law faces conditions similar to Prohibition and other historical episodes of enforcement failure. When infringements are widespread, effective deterrence cannot be attained without raising enforcement to levels that undermine the support for the underlying rules. As a result, enforcement has the inadvertent effect of moving behavior in the opposite direction from that intended by the law. In the context of copyright law, enforcement has increased the gap between the social and legal perceptions of copyright law. Because file sharers, as a group, perceive copyright litigation as excessive, this inadvertently strengthens opposition to the legally protected interests of copyright law. \n\nTo further our understanding of the interplay between enforcement and public attitudes, we conduct two empirical studies on norms and copyright law. The results confirm that copyright enforcement is a double-edged sword. While stringent sanctions have a modest deterrent effect on file-sharing behavior, they increase anti-copyright sentiments among frequent offenders. This raises a spectacular challenge for copyright enforcement-the more copyright owners push to step up sanctions for copyright infringements; the more the public resents the protected rights. Consequently, stepping up sanctions tends to increase - rather than decrease - the rate and frequency of infringing activities. Our key results suggest therefore, that more stringent copyright enforcement will further erode respect for copyrights and may prove counterproductive to copyright owners.",

      "abstract": "The protection of copyrights in the music industry has been of paramount concern as the popularity of digital music players, personal websites, and filesharing continues to grow, each of which subsequently contributes to the persistence of Internet music piracy. While the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) links filesharing to copyright piracy, others argue that filesharing allows maximum exposure of artists\u2019 music which in turn increases its value. While this debate continues, little empirical research has specifically addressed the behavioral aspects of the consumer. In this paper, we use survey data on university students to study how attitudes toward copyright law along with economic and demographic factors affect the extent of music copyright violations. We find that while students are responsive to economic incentives and perceptions of risk, the extent of these incentives has not reversed the overall propensity to engage in filesharing.",

Therefore, this study examined whether low self-control and deviant peer associations explained various forms of cyberdeviance in a youth sample. We also tested whether associating with deviant peers mediated the effect of low self-control on cyberdeviance as well as whether it conditioned the effect. Low self-control and deviant peer associations were found to be related to cyberdeviance in general, as well as piracy, harassment, online pornography, and hacking specifically. Deviant peer associations both mediated and exacerbated the effect of low self-control on general cyberdeviance, though these interactions were not found for the five cyberdeviant types examined.",

First, we develop a path model that highlights not only the key factors that promote software piracy, but also the inter-relationships between these factors. Second, most studies have used the dataset from the pre-2003 methodology which only accounted for business software and did not take into account local market conditions. Using the latest dataset and a large sample of countries (n=61) we find there is an important triadic relationship between PDI, IDV, and GNI that explains over 80% of the variance in software piracy rates.

This information is important because studies of internet piracy had not yet confirmed the presence and predictability of internet piracy in high school students.

Following Png and Wang (2006), the production equation of recorded music is developed. Meanwhile, the author introduces other independent variables such as per capita GDP, employment rate and R&D, population and economic openness. The econometric methods consist of two way fixed effects method, Arellano-Bond dynamic panel-data estimation and dynamic panel-data estimation, one-step difference GMM (generalized method of moments) by use of Stata 10.0. The findings are as followings: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection exerts positive effect on recorded music sales, and the influencing coefficient is at the range of 0.815 to 0.915. Meanwhile, economic openness also has positive influence. The studying results suggest that IPRs protection can reinforce the sale of recorded music, and it is very urgent to enhance IPRs protection.",

      "abstract": "The availability of digital channels for media distribution has raised several important questions for marketers, notably whether digital distribution channels will cannibalize physical sales and whether legitimate digital distribution channels will dissuade consumers from using (illegitimate) digital piracy channels. We address these two questions using the removal of NBC content from Apple\u2019s iTunes store in December 2007, and its restoration in September 2008, as natural shocks to the supply of legitimate digital content, and analyzing its impact on demand through BitTorrent piracy channels and the Amazon.com DVD store. \n\nTo do this we collect two large datasets from Mininova and Amazon.com documenting levels of piracy and DVD sales for both NBC and other major networks\u2019 content around these events. We analyze this data in a difference-in-difference model and find that NBC\u2019s decision to remove its content from iTunes in December 2007 is causally associated with an 11.2% increase in the demand for pirated content. This is roughly equivalent to an increase of 49,000 downloads a day for NBC's content and is approximately twice as large as the total legal purchases on iTunes for the same content in the period preceding the removal. We also find evidence of a smaller, and statistically insignificant, decrease in piracy for the same content when it was restored to the iTunes store in September 2008. Finally, we see no change in demand for NBC\u2019s DVD content at Amazon.com associated with NBC\u2019s closing or reopening of their digital distribution channel on iTunes.",

      "data_description": "The paper uses NBCs withdrawal of content from the iTunes platform as a natural experiment to observe the effect of this \"shock to supply\" on levels of piracy among the content of NBC and a number of its competitor producers. The focus of the study is on the 4-week period around December 1st 2007 when the content was withdrawn and the 4-week period around September 9th 2008 when the content was reinstated.     \n\nThis paper draws on two main secondary sources of data: Mininova BitTorrent tracker and Amazon Sales Rankings\n\nThe first of these is a survey of BitTorrent tracker files reported by Mininova.org as a proxy for piracy activity on the programs in the sample. \n\nThe piracy dataset contains the daily number of downloads for 5,200 unique episodes of television (corresponding to roughly 75 unique series) starting November 16, 2007. The data include the series name, season number, and episode number of each television program and the number of times that file was downloaded each day. \n\nThe study also controls for the network that owns the rights to the show, the genre of the show, and whether it is a series that is still producing new episodes (such as Heroes) or a \u201ccatalog\u201d series (such as the original Star Trek). \n\nThis dataset was created from a larger dataset collected by monitoring all trackers posted to Mininova at the torrent level starting in November 2007, obtaining roughly 210,000 records per day and yielding dataset of over 68 million observations for 180,000\ntorrents. \n\nThe study also analyses piracy for television programming from the other major television networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, and Fox \u2014 as a control.\n\nThe second source of data is Amazon DVD sales rankings. Using existing research the study estimates the parameters of the relationship between Amazon.com sales rank and actual sales of the product.",

In other words, iTunes purchasers may avoid piracy because the fixed cost to learn to use BitTorrent (or the fixed moral/stigma cost of illegal behavior) makes piracy less attractive than iTunes.\n\n* When the digital sales channel is not available, these individuals turn to piracy, pay the fixed cost and, owing to the seemingly low marginal costs of additional downloads, begin to consume much more content through piracy than they had previously purchased.  \n\n* When NBC removed their archived seasons of television from iTunes, we found no significant change in the Amazon.com sales rank for NBC\u2019s DVD sales relative to the trend that we saw for non-NBC box sets. One possible interpretation of this finding is that digital downloads and DVD\u2019s are simply not substitutes in the short term.  \n\n*Adding a digital distribution channel would not lead to a short-term displacement in DVD box set sales. A similar interpretation is that there is a fixed cost to digital viewing of television, and once a consumer has \u201cgone digital\u201d she is unlikely to come back.",

Using clickstream data on a panel of more than 16,000 European consumers, we estimate the effects of illegal downloading and legal streaming on the legal purchases of digital music. Our results suggest that Internet users do not view illegal downloading as a substitute to legal digital music. Although positive and significant, our estimated elasticities are essentially zero: a 10% increase in clicks on illegal downloading websites leads to a 0.2% increase in clicks on legal purchases websites. Online music streaming services are found to have a somewhat larger (but still small) effect on the purchases of digital sound recordings, suggesting complementarities between these two modes of music consumption. According to our results, a 10% increase in clicks on legal streaming websites lead to up to a 0.7% increase in clicks on legal digital purchases websites. We find important cross country difference in these effects.",

If piracy leads to substantial sales displacement of music in physical format, then its effect on the overall music industry revenues may well still be negative.\n\n* The effect of online music streaming on the legal purchases of digital music suggests complementarity between streaming services and purchases of legal digital music. However this effect is different across countries: it is larger for France and the UK while it is smaller for Spain and Italy.\n\n* Digital music revenues to record companies are growing substantially, reflecting the increasing importance of digitization in the music industry (IFPI, 2012).

However, mobile phone usage is rapidly expanding. The reasons for this pattern of information and communications technology adoption may be cultural, political, or economic, but the delay in some technological access also, paradoxically, fosters creativity. Through peer-to-peer content sharing via mobile devices, the consumption and exchange of digital content has become quite common. Indeed, these uses of the mobile phone exemplify convergence, the integration of digital audio, video, text, and data, as well as a social change in the way media circulates. Ethnographic research and interviews conducted in Armenia during the spring and summer of 2008 examine how, by whom, and what types of digital content are being socially shared through mobile devices. Theoretical possibilities to explain the social utility of this phenomenon are presented as well.",

Unfortunately, disentangling these two effects is extremely difficult.\nIn this paper we attempt to disentangle these two effects by applying fixed effects and first difference models to a new dataset quantifying changes in broadband Internet penetration and DVD sales at a local level from 2000 to 2003. We then compare our results to those reported in Liebowitz (2008), who uses similar models in a similar time period on a similar product category: music CDs.\nUnlike Liebowitz, who finds a strong negative impact of broadband penetration on music sales, our results show that increased broadband penetration leads to a significant increase in DVD sales. Using the most conservative results, 9.3% of the $14.1 billion increase in DVD sales during our study period can be attributed to increased broadband penetration. One interpretation of these results is that the difference arises from differences in the ability\nto pirate these two types of content: while Internet music piracy was easy and rampant from 2000 to 2003, Internet movie piracy was difficult and of generally low quality in this time period. If this interpretation is true it would suggest that, in the absence of piracy, the Internet has an overall strong positive impact on media sales.",

Yet music purchases have decayed sharply since the introduction of file sharing a decade ago. This paper seeks to measure the effect of peer-to-peer file sharing on music sales. I use a long panel of twelve years of country-level data containing information on both physical and digital music sales and on Internet and broadband penetration. This database includes not only information going back to a period when peer-to-peer downloading did not exist, but also includes more recent information up to 2008. I employ Internet connectedness and the speed of Internet connections as proxies for unauthorized downloading, and study whether physical and total country-level music purchases have decayed more rapidly in countries experiencing faster increases in the adoption of file swapping technology. This paper uses the increase in broadband penetration replacing dial-up in order to isolate the effect of file sharing from any other possible Internet impact on music sales. My results indicate that peer-to-peer file-sharing can explain a reduction in music sales that ranges from half of the actual decrease in sales up to the entire decrease.",

At the heart of the problem is the trade-off between social welfare and incentives to create. Creating is costly, while the marginal cost of producing a digital copy from the original is zero. Without considering the incentives of creators and with zero marginal cost, social welfare would be maximized by allowing the product to be copied freely. However, if incentives to create are hampered due to piracy, there are no creative products to consume. In a dynamic setting, when incentives are considered, piracy can thus result in a welfare loss. However, piracy affects incentives to create through reduced revenue only if consumers who would have otherwise\nbought a legal product acquire an illegal copy, that is, if piracy substitutes sales. \n\nFrom the creator\u2019s perspective the consequences of copying and thus incentives to create depend on the \u201cmarket harm\u201d of copying: the way in which the availability of unauthorized copies substitutes sales and decreases revenue.

Digital rights management systems aim to prevent unauthorized copying and to reduce the overall rate of piracy. Therefore, the recent move toward offering DRM-free music by some major online music sellers appears paradoxical. In this article, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes and estimates the concept of hardcore piracy in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Based on two large empirical studies and a validation exercise with a large sample of more 2000 college students, the model results indicate that the music industry can benefit from removing DRM because such a strategy has the potential to convert some pirates into paying consumers. In addition, a DRM-free environment enhances both consumer and producer welfare by increasing the demand for legitimate products as well as consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for these products. The authors find that producers could benefit by lowering prices from currently observed levels.

      "abstract": "Digital piracy is seen as a significant problem for the creative industries. Still, while there have been many academic studies showing that piracy hurts sales, there have been far fewer studies analyzing the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures in reversing this effect. This study attempts to address this question by analyzing how the HADOPI \u201cthree strikes\u201d law in France affected digital music sales on the iTunes music store. To do this, we obtained a panel of iTunes sales data from the four major music labels (Universal\nMusic, Warner Music, EMI Music and Sony Music) across a broad set of countries. We then applied a difference-in-difference approach, using sales trends in a control group of European countries to simulate the counterfactual of what music sales in France would have been if HADOPI had not been passed. Our results suggest that increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group. In terms of robustness, we find that these sales changes are similar for each of the four major music labels, suggesting that our results are not peculiar to any particular label. We also find that the observed sales increase is much larger in genres that, prior to HADOPI, experienced high piracy levels (e.g., Rap and Hip Hop) than for less pirated genres (e.g., Christian music, classical, and jazz). This strengthens the causal interpretation of our results since if HADOPI is causing pirates to become legitimate purchases, its effects should be stronger for heavily pirated music than it is for other music genres.",

      "data_description": "The main data set for this study is weekly iTunes sales units for a number of European countries including France. The data extend from July 2008 to May 2011, and observe separately both track unit sales and album unit sales. The data were obtained directly from the four major music labels \u2014 EMI, Sony, Universal, and Warner \u2014 and aggregated to reflect total iTunes sales for the majors. \n\nThe study looks at the five European countries (other than France) with the highest iTunes sales levels as our control group for France, under the theory that overall market trends would have the most similar impact on countries with closer sales levels. This study observes weekly iTunes sales units for France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Belgium. This yields 918 country-by-week observations of total iTunes sales units, broken down into albums and tracks.\n\nTo measure awareness of the new HADOPI law, the study collected Google Trends data on Google searches (from France) for the search term \u201cHADOPI.\u201d13 Google Trends reports the \u201crelative search index\u201d for a search term in a given country, meaning that for each week we observe the number of searches for that term relative to the average number of all searches in that country across each week in the date range. So, for example, if there were an average of 20,000 searches per week in our date range for the term HADOPI, then in a week where there were 100,000 searches, the Google Trends index would report \u201c5.0\u201d for that week. Thus, while we do not know the actual volume of searches, we know when awareness of HADOPI peaked as measured by Google searches, and the relative height of that peak. This can serve as a measure of national awareness of the law. \n\nThe authors thank four major record labels for providing data to support this research. They also state the while this research was undertaken independently, the IFPI has compensated Danaher for his time to present the results of this study to the IFPI and to produce a non-technical version of this paper for their internal use.",

Assuming an average song price of \u20ac1 per song, this equates to an increase of \u20ac4.7 million ($6.3 million) in annual iTunes track revenues.\n\n* Results suggest that HADOPI causally increased French digital albums sales by an average of 11,200 units per week. Assuming an average of \u20ac8.5 per album, this equates to an increase of \u20ac4.9 million ($6.7 million) in annual iTunes album sales due to HADOPI.\n\n* Together, our estimates suggest that HADOPI increased annual iTunes revenues (tracks plus albums) by about \u20ac9.6 million ($13 million) per year for the four majors combined.\n\n* Under the assumption that the four majors make up 70% of the industry, if sales for the remaining 30% of artists experienced the same change in sales as we observe for the major labels, then the impact of HADOPI was to increase overall digital iTunes sales by \u20ac13.8 million ($18.6 million) per year for the entire music industry.\n\n* The effect of HADOPI was larger for more heavily pirated genres like Rap and smaller for less pirated genres like Christian music or Jazz, which is what one would expect if the increase in sales were causally related to HADOPI.\n\n* Increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group.\n\n* The study occurs before anyone received a third notice (i.e. before any cases have been referred to the criminal court), and the increase in sales is observed even before the law\u2019s final passage. While this may seem irrational, it is consistent with the idea that increasing the salience of the law, the illegality of piracy, and the potential penalties is sufficient to change user behavior.",

      "abstract": "Although downloading music through unapproved channels is illegal, statistics indicate that it is widespread. The following study examines the attitudes and perceptions of college students that are potentially engaged in music downloading. The methodology includes a content analysis of the recommendations written to answer an ethical vignette. The vignette presented the case of a subject who faces the dilemma of whether or not to download music illegally. Analyses of the final reports indicate that there is a vast and inconsistent array of actions and underlying feelings toward digital music downloading. The findings reveal inconsistencies between participants\u2019 recommendations (what the subject should do) and their attitudes and opinions on the matter (what they would do in a similar situation). These inconsistencies support the notion that as technology evolves, it creates discrepancies between the way things are and the way the law expects them to be, leaving society in a muddle, trying to reconcile the two. What remains to be seen is whether the discrepancy in the case of music downloading becomes extreme enough that the law changes to accommodate an increasingly prevalent behavior, or whether new business models will emerge to bridge the gap between legality and reality.",

To fill this gap, we conducted a study from the perspective of music consumers in which we grounded a theory that would explain and predict individual arguments and behavior. Our findings suggest that the morality of accessing culture depends on the social, economic and cultural context in which an individual has been raised. Interestingly, this contextual aspect interacts with economic and cultural resources, affecting the moral arguments used to justify behavior. Lastly, we describe a model that explains variations in the contextual theory in regard to accessing music and that predicts consumer behavior in other countries that can be classified in either of the two contexts delineated in our research.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, YouTube and other sites for sharing video files over the Internet have vaulted from obscurity to places of centrality in the media landscape. The files available at YouTube include a mix of user-generated video and clips from network television shows. Networks fear that availability of their clips on YouTube will depress television viewing. But unauthorized clips are also free advertising for television shows. As YouTube has grown quickly, major networks have responded by making their content available at their own sites. This paper examines the effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution on television viewing between 2005 and 2007 using a survey of Penn students on their tendencies to watch television series on television as well as on the web. The results provide a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use YouTube and related sites. While I find some evidence of substitution of web viewing for conventional television viewing, time spent viewing programming on the web - 4 hours per week - far exceeds the reduction in weekly traditional television viewing of about 25 minutes. Overall time spent on network-controlled viewing (television plus network websites) increased by 1.5 hours per week.",

We compare the impacts of increased high-speed online connectedness replacing slow-speed Internet connectedness before and after the introduction of the second-generation file sharing technology that has made movie file sharing feasible. This empirical strategy allows us to isolate the effects of file sharing from any other possible Internet impacts on the commercial performance of movies unrelated to file sharing. Our results indicate that the effect of peer-to-peer file sharing is negative and large on video sales, but we do not have confidence regarding the impacts of file sharing on either the theatrical commercial performance of movies or video rentals.",

This paper explores DVD piracy in particular, and focuses on identifying different types of pirating behaviour and the antecedents to this behaviour. Four distinct types of \u2018pirates\u2019 were identified, based on a cross-sectional sample of UK adults. These groups were serious pirates (\u2018Devils\u2019), opportunists (\u2018Chancers\u2019), receivers (\u2018Receivers\u2019) and non-pirates (\u2018Angels\u2019). A structural equation modelling approach was used to establish the importance of key antecedents for the overall sample and the four sub groups. The base model fitted the overall sample very well as for the sub group \u2018Chancers\u2019, but as expected, there were significant differences in model fit and the importance of key variables between the different behaviour types. The construct of \u2018perceived harm\u2019 emerged as an important differentiator in all models. The results suggest that targeting anti-pirating measures specifically at different types of behaviour and their antecedents may increase the effectiveness of such measures and also assist with the efficient allocation of limited resources in this area.",

      "abstract": "Hollywood films are generally released first in the United States and then later abroad, with some variation in lags across films and countries. With the growth in movie piracy since the appearance of BitTorrent in 2003, films have become available through illegal piracy immediately after release in the US, while they are not available for legal viewing abroad until their foreign premieres in each country. We make use of this variation in international release lags to ask whether longer lags \u2013 which facilitate more local pre-release piracy \u2013 depress theatrical box office receipts, particularly after the widespread adoption of BitTorrent. We find that longer release windows are associated with decreased box office returns, even after controlling for film and country fixed effects. This relationship is much stronger in contexts where piracy is more prevalent: after BitTorrent\u2019s adoption and in heavily-pirated genres. Our findings indicate that, as a lower bound, international box office returns in our sample were at least 7% lower than they would have been in the absence of pre-release piracy. By contrast, we do not see evidence of elevated sales displacement in US box office revenue following the adoption of BitTorrent, and we suggest that delayed legal availability of the content abroad may drive the losses to piracy.",

The dependent variable of the study was legal vs illegal downloading of music. A 20-item questionnaire was completed by 84 respondents. The final four questions in the study were guilt-inducing questions(which the respondent was informed of in compliance with ethical primary research); the remainder of the questions were neutral in nature.\n\nFindings \u2013 The paper finds that the respondents illegally download despite viewing the act as immoral. Respondents choose to morally disengage from the non-ethical nature of the act in an attempt to avoid feeling guilty about illegal downloading and also to avoid any blame being attributed to them personally. Many respondents feel the act of illegal downloading is simply today\u2019s reality and that there is nothing wrong or immoral about illegal downloading. Those who illegally download were less likely to attack the activity for being wrong. Active music fans were more likely to engage in illegal downloading than passive ones. Being a student versus being gainfully employed did not affect downloading behaviour.\n\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 A limitation of the study was the difficulty in getting people to disclose the truth about their own ethical violations. A related limitation was the difficulty in obtaining respondents, since participation in such a study meant revealing their music consumption behaviour. However, in the end, social networking proved to be a successful way of recruiting participants.\n\nPractical implications \u2013 The results cast light on the obstacles managers in the music business face in eliminating music piracy.\n\nSocial implications \u2013 The results show the reasons for the difficulties in eliminating this widespread crime, because of the ethical ambiguity involved.\n\nOriginality/value \u2013 The study has the effect of explaining music piracy very clearly through the application of ethical/psychological theory.

This article estimates the effects of factors influencing WTP for digital music downloads.

A  particular emphasis  was placed  on  the  importance  of  cultural  and  risk  aspect  in  music piracy in  this  paper. It  takes  into account a large sample of micro - level behavioral data of university students from the U.S. and Switzerland. We show that  despite  the  fact  that  these  countries  are  two  western, industrialized and  technologically  advanced nations, students have differences  in  national  cultureand they view  and  treat  copyright  differently,  which ultimately affects the propensity to engage in music piracy.Our results show that consumer behavior can differ even  among  developed  and  technologically  advanced  countries.We  show  that  compared  to  Swiss  students, American  students  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  music  piracy. With  respect  to  the  demographic  factors,  male students are more prone to piracy, whereas older students are less likely to engage in such activity. Finally, the key risk variables perceived probability of getting caught when conducting such illegal activity and the resulting penalty to be paid are negatively associated with music piracy behavior.This paper provides important insights which can be used to have tailored policies to alleviate piracy behavior in each country.",

Specifically, the study developed a three-factor model that indicated that low self-control, combined with social learning, could lead to digital piracy. This supports Hirschi and Gottfredson\u2019s (1993) assertion that self-control is impacted by constraints. The constraint in this case is the need for individuals to learn how to perform digital piracy. The authors suggest that universities seeking to reduce digital piracy should consider developing policies and programs based on social learning theory. Participants were 392 college students who completed a self-report questionnaire measuring aspects of social control, association with digital pirating peers, attitudes toward software piracy, and intentions to commit digital piracy. The analysis involved the use of structural equation modeling to test how four models of low self-control and social learning combined to produce the commission of digital piracy. Future research should use different measures of digital piracy and should consider the theoretical links that low self-control has with other theories in terms of their contribution to explaining digital piracy. Future research should also consider using a longitudinal design.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to deepen the knowledge of consumer behaviour in information goods markets, taking as a reference the sound recording market. In particular, its aim is twofold: on the one hand it attempts to get new insights on consumers paying special attention to their willingness to pay and to purchasing behaviour; on the other hand it wants to find out whether the recently adopted increase in legal measures against consumers by industries can have positive effects on lowering copyright infringement and raising legal demand. Using experimental methods, we elicited individual preferences in legal and burned CDs. We used hypothetical as well as real choices. Our experimental results suggest that lawsuits can effectively lower the rate of copying because they raise the probability of being caught by consumers and thus punished. However, they do not necessarily raise legal sales since the measured consumer willingness to pay is generally lower than the market price for legal products.

The results show that moral obligation and justice, derived from ethics theories and TPB variables, such as attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, influence the behavioral intentions of individuals to commit digital piracy.

Because we lack evidence on the rate at which unpaid consumption displaces paid consumption, we know little about the size of the effect of pirate consumption on the volume of paid consumption. We provide direct evidence on both the volume of unpaid consumption and the rate of sales displacement for movies in China using two surveys administered in late 2008 and mid-2009. First, using a survey of Chinese college students\u2019 movie consumption and an empirical approach parallel to a similar recent study of US college students, we find that three quarters of movie consumption is unpaid and that each instance of unpaid consumption displaces 0.14 paid consumption instances. Second, a survey of online Chinese consumers reveals similar patterns of paid and unpaid movie consumption but a displacement rate of roughly zero. We speculate on the small displacement rate finding relative to most of the piracy literature.",

The short-term implications examined concern direct costs and benefits to society, whereas the long-term impact concerns changes in the industry's business models as well as in cultural diversity and the accessibility of content. It observes that the proliferation of digital distribution networks combined with the availability of digital technology among consumers has broken the entertainment industries' control over the access to their products. Only part of the decline in music sales can be attributed to file sharing. Despite the losses for the music industry, the increased accessibillity of culture renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive.

This strategy resulted in the current backlash, providing space for a new entrant establishing a major brand in the online music business: Apple's iTunes. \n\n*Reinvention of the business model looks like the only way out for the traditional players in the music industry. The music economy appears to be facing a shift in spending away from recordings to concert tickets and, to a lesser degree, merchandise. The advance of so called 360-degree artist contracts is a step towards greater diversification of sources of income and underlines the clear connection that exists between various revenue sources in different music markets: recordings, live music and merchandise. \n\n*The entertainment industry should step outside the box of the traditional value chain and venture into a host of other markets through the creation of value networks. \n\n*A strategy that focuses solely on lawsuits and digital rights management (DRM) is not the best response, in particular as it remains to be seen whether a fully authorised, paid-for downloading market would generate sufficient revenues to stay in business. Even in a hypothetical future without file sharing, a hybrid business model would appear to be the solution.\n\n*And so the entertainment industry will have to work actively towards innovation on all fronts. New models worth developing, for example, are those that seek to achieve commercial diversification or that match supply and end-user needs more closely. In such a context, criminalising large parts of the population makes no sense. Enforcement should focus on large scale and/or commercial upload activities.",

This renders the overall welfare effects of file sharing robustly positive.\n\n*For example, the authors state that the consumer surplus created by music sharing in the Netherlands amounts to an estimated minimum of \u20ac200 million per year; a conservative estimate. At most half this amount is generated at the expense of the producer surplus and therefore constitutes a transfer of welfare. The remainder constitutes welfare gains.\n\n*The film industry is feeling the file-sharing pain less than is the music business, but this looks about to change as broadband is rolled out further. \n\n*The 'digitally native' games industry would seem better positioned to respond to the impact of file sharing, although some segments of the market, particularly the one for PC games, witnesses effects similar to the music industry. \n\n*The survey held among Dutch Internet users has shown that file sharing is here to stay and that people who download are at the same time important customers of the entertainment industry; therefore criminalising them makes no sense.",

      "abstract": "The widespread use of computers and the Internet has provided many advantages to everyday life, but also created new opportunities for unethical and illegal acts such as software piracy. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) and International Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that worldwide software piracy rate went up to 41 percent in 2008 and worldwide losses to software vendors due to software piracy totaled more than $50 billion in 2008 (BSA and IDC, 2009). Besides being an economic problem, software piracy is also an ethical issue, especially in academic settings. The evidences from numerous studies suggest that many undergraduate students consider software piracy and other unethical use of information technologies as an acceptable behavior.\n\n\nThe main purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationships between the demographic characteristics of freshman students and their attitudes towards software piracy. Data were obtained from a survey sample of 125 students in the Department of Business Administration at a public university in Turkey. The study found that overall attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy are close to neutral position on the Likert scale. The results of the regression analysis showed that monthly family income and duration of Internet usage in a week affected attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy, but to a lower extent.",

      "abstract": "We focus our analysis on how reported changes in P2P downloading by individuals related to their reported changes in CD demand between 2004 and 2005 to test the hypothesis whether P2P downloading may be reducing CD demand. All of our regression results (reported in Tables 2 and 3 below) show a negative association between P2P downloading and CD demand as might be expected. We consistently find a negative and statistically significant partial correlation between CD purchases and P2P downloads. The range of these estimated correlations is between -0.039 and -0.050, with more consistent, mid-range values coming from the difference on difference regressions (-0.041 and -0.043). This implies a 10% increase in P2P downloads reduces CD demand by around 0.4%.\nThis paper extends the work of Barker (2012) which analysed a question in the Industry Canada survey which asked respondents to comment on their likely behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing. In this study we analyse the respondents reported actual behaviour, rather than their likely behaviour in hypothetical situations. Barker\u2019s (2012) analysis is consistent with our results here however in also suggesting P2P downloads have negative effects on legitimate music purchases.",

Consistent negative and statistically significant partial correlation between CD demand and P2P downloads.\n\n*In this paper we have corrected for two fundamental errors in previous analysis by AF leading to their erroneous conclusion. First we corrected for the fact AF biased their results by excluding from their analysis the group of consumers who had completely stopped purchasing CD\u2019s (potentially because of P2P activity) prior to 2005. This is the very group who were most responsive, or likely to have substituted P2P downloading for CD purchases. Second we controlled for the fact that the level of an individual\u2019s demand for CD\u2019s, and the level of an individual\u2019s P2P downloading may be correlated simply because they are both affected by the same third factor, such as love of music, so that high (or low) levels of CD demand is likely to be associated with high (low) levels of P2P demand. Such a positive association between the level of demand and level of P2P downloading may have led AF to mistakenly conclude they had found evidence of a positive market creation effect, as AF regressed the level of individuals CD demand against the level of individuals P2P downloading. Instead we focused on the changes in CD demand and changes in P2P downloading, using data in the survey that AF ignored on 2004 and 2005 behaviours of participants. By focusing on a longitudinal analysis of how the change in individual P2P downloading behaviour affected the change in CD demand we were better able to isolate the true relationship between increases or changes in P2P downloading and changes in CD demand.",

      "abstract": "Consumers of software often face an acquisition-mode decision, namely whether to purchase or pirate that software. In terms of consumer welfare, consumers who pirate software may stand in opposition to those who purchase it. Marketers also face a decision whether to attempt to thwart that piracy or to ignore, if not encourage it as an aid to their software's diffusion, and policymakers face the decision whether to adopt interventionist policies, which are government-centric, or laissez faire policies, which are marketer-centric. Here in order to assess the decision-making of all three of these stakeholders, we focus on the consumer's point-of-view as central and examine it by considering on a comparative basis the ethical dimension versus other dimensions, including economic,legal, and other salient consumer behavior considerations. Based on a survey of 689 software consumers conducted over the Internet, the results indicate that ethics as a factor is embedded in a multidimensional set of determinant factors influencing software piracy, including attitudes, legal aspects, social support,perceptions of economic loss and age. Policy and research implications, based on these findings, are provided.",

      "abstract": "Each year billions of dollars are lost due to illegal downloading and copying of intellectual property. Individuals often perceive little or no consequences as a result of digital piracy. Research has shown that perceived consequences could be used to alter an individual's ethical intention to engage in digital piracy (INT). In addition subjective norm (SUN) may also contribute to INT. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the factors of perceived consequences and to assess their contribution, as well as the contribution of SUN, to INT.\nThis predictive study developed a quantitative instrument to measure the contribution of the factors of perceived consequences and SUN on INT. In phase one of this study, an anonymous exploratory questionnaire was used to gather a list of perceived consequences. That list was combined with a list of perceived consequences found through an extensive review of the literature and a survey instrument was developed and used in phase two. After data cleaning, a total of 407 responses remained. Exploratory factor analysis incorporating principal component analysis (PCA) identified eight factors of INT: Personal Emotional Consequences (PEC), Freedom Consequences (FRC), Minor Consequences (MIC), Personal Freedom Consequences (PFC), Personal Moral Consequences (PMC), Network Access Consequences (NAC), Self Worth Consequences (SWC), and Industry Financial Consequences (IFC). A model was developed using Ordinal Logistic Regression to determine the contribution of the eight factors of perceived consequences and SUN on INT.\nPEC, PMC, and IFC as well as SUN were found to be significant contributors to INT. The Mann-Whitney U test determined that INT was the only factor that showed a significant difference for males. Additionally, gender was a significant contributor to FRC, MIC, PFC, PMC, SWC, and IFC. Each of these factors was more significant for females than males. The Kruskal-Wallis test determined that there were no significant differences in the factors of perceived consequences, SUN, and INT based on age or computer usage. Important contributions of this study include the identification of eight perceived consequence factors not previously known as well as the development of a unified predictive model, addressing all forms of digital piracy.",

Evaluations of illegal music downloading and their association with downloading behaviour were examined using social domain theory in a sample of 188 ethnically diverse college students (M.age = 19.80 years, SD = 1.36, 56% female). All students treated prototypical moral events as moral on a domain classification task. Students treated illegal downloading as a complex moral issue and, less frequently, as a personal issue (but rarely as a conventional issue of law or authority); judgments varied when different concerns regarding the fair price of music and the structure of the music industry were made salient. Greater discrepancies between the actual price of music and what students viewed to be fair were associated with past illegal downloading, while a greater focus on downloading as stealing was associated with abstaining from downloading.",

Using data on a sample of undergraduate students, we study the determinants of music piracy by looking at whether a respondent\u2019s last song was obtained illegally or not. In doing so, we incorporate (i) the individual-specific transactions costs that constitute the effective price of illegal music; and (ii) individual willingness to pay (WTP) for digital music, which we elicit using a simple field experiment and which we use to control for the unobserved heterogeneity of preferences between respondents. Our empirical results indicate that a respondent\u2019s subjective probability of facing a lawsuit and her degree of morality both have a negative impact on the likelihood that her last song was obtained illegally.

The research was conducted at a large eastern university. Sixteen students participated in four small focus groups; 15 individuals participated in in-depth interviews.Twenty-two participants were undergraduates, and nine were graduate students. They ranged in age from 18 to 27. The majority of subjects were Caucasian; there were two Hispanics, one Asian-American, and one African American.\n\n*The second phase was a quantitative phase, completed in June 2009 (Sheehan, Tsao, and Yang, 2010). A convenience sample of 204 college students from a large eastern university participated in an anonymous survey. Respondents were recruited from four undergraduate classes and one graduate class. The questionnaire included 59 questions related to the authors\u2019 previous qualitative study of this subject.\n\n*The third phase, completed in March 2010, was an experimental phase entailing advertising-concept testing. Phase III included 415 participants from two universities; 48 percent of the sample came from a large eastern university, and 52 percent came from a mid-sized mid-western university. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents were male and 71 percent female.\nParticipants were randomly divided into 10 groups: eight experimental groups - each evaluating a separate concept - one generic group, and one control group.\n\n*The fourth phase, completed in December 2010, was an experimental stage. Two advertising campaigns were developed: the first campaign focused on the potential cost of ruining your computer based on catching a virus and ran at a mid-sized midwestern university, and the second focused on the risk that illegal downloading could affect your ability to get a job once you graduate from school, and ran at a large eastern university. The campaigns ran at significant weight levels on both campuses. After the last advertisements ran in student media, students on each campus were randomly sampled using a short question-naire. Campaign 1 was tested against 151 participants: 43 percent of the respondents were male, 57 percent female. Campaign 2 was tested against 462 participants: 32 percent of the respondents were male, 68 percent female.",

Rather, they should perceive the problem as fundamentally group oriented, or social. This indicates that grass roots efforts within colleges that focus on times when students are assembled either physically or in social networks could prove effective. \n\n*In terms of broader communication, messages with the objective of overturning peer group social acceptance by showing the cost of the behavior on the peer group, its image, or society at large might be more effective than focus on individual risks. \n\n*In addition to social strategies, any program, legal approach, or advertising campaign aiming to increase the perception of personal risk needs to reframe the perception of risk substantially. Aside from using on-campus servers, the perception of personal risk to college students is, today, very small. \n\n*A swift and drastic shift in perception would be important not just on an individual basis but because it could create a social tipping point among college peers. A key to combining personal and social costs might be to focus on things related to music piracy that could cause extreme personal embarrassment within the insular social peer networks of college campuses.",

Higher levels of social acceptance led to stronger motivations to illegally download.\n\n*A previously researched result was reinforced: when moral conscience was low, desire to illegally download is high (Gopal et al., 2004). Rather than being an absolute measure of moral conscience (i.e., right vs. wrong), if we look at this through the social lens, we can see it more as a measure of what is deemed socially acceptable or unacceptable. \n\n*In personal and group interviews, the legal cost for downloading using on-campus servers was seen as extremely high. Most respondents had a friend, or had heard of someone, who had been caught and/or fined. Off campus, in the \u201creal world,\u201d however, respondents indicated that their fear of being caught was infinitesimally small. \n\n*With such a low perceived possibility of being caught, it is reasonable to theorize that the optimistic bias of college kids regarding legal costs grew to such an extent that legal costs no longer had the potential to act as a brake on illegal behavior.",

      "abstract": "Software piracy is a major economic concern for organizations. Previous research indicates that neutralization, a form of rationalization, can help explain software piracy intentions. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of which neutralization techniques most influence software piracy intention. To address this gap, we developed a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intention. We included different types of deterrents (formal sanctions, shame, and moral belief) in our model because individuals may use neutralization techniques to mitigate feelings of guilt and shame, which, subsequently, reduce the deterrent effect. Our empirical results (for 183 people surveyed) showed that appeal to higher loyalties and condemn the condemners strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, informal deterrents such as shame and moral beliefs are strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational intervention aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques rather than relying on formal sanctions.",

      "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Illegal downloading of music has become an inexorable and rampant activity particularly among college students who have been little deterred by industry legal actions. The purpose of this research is to examine the present state of downloading and how ethical orientation and attitudes towards MP3 piracy impact such activities. This paper also aims to use ethical scenarios as a way of understanding the ethical reasoning in illegal downloading.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 Key research questions are proposed that are related to illegal downloading. A sample of 364 university students was used to examine each research question. Statistical results are reported.\n\nFindings \u2013 The results clearly show that downloading continues at a high rate today driven by strong belief that it is not ethically wrong. Ethical orientation was found to be positively associated with awareness of the social cost of downloading, consequences of downloading, and ethical belief in downloading. Ethical scenarios show that ethical orientation is also associated with downloading activities and with stealing. Other results indicate that respondents believe that their peers are more prone to stealing music and downloading MP3s illegally. Fear of consequences does seem to have an impact on the propensity to download illegally.\n\nPractical Implications \u2013 The paper contributes to inform industry representatives that appeal to ethic or guilt are not likely to deter illegal downloading measurably. The use of punishment for downloaders may have a short-term effect but other (more positive) measures are required.\n\nOriginality/value \u2013 No research has examined downloading MP3s in the manner developed in this paper. The paper contributes to a better understanding of consumer behavior among those who download. The results provide insight into a serious problem in the recording industry that is likely to persist in the distant future unless sound measures are developed.",

      "abstract": "Due to the development of information technology, music piracy has become an escalating problem. This study attempts to employ the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the social identity theory to investigate the antecedents of downloading pop music illegally from the Internet, the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music, and the moderating effects of idolatry. Data were collected from 350 teenagers in Northern Taiwan through questionnaire interviews conducted in city centers where teenagers gather. The results of partial least squares (PLS) analyses reconfirm the explanatory power of the TPB model with regard to the pop music illegal downloading behavior. However, it is interesting to note that the intention to illegally download music does not have a significant influence on the intention to buy music. This finding contradicts our common intuitions. Further analyses also reveal that idolatry moderates the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music. For teenagers with high idolatry, a higher music downloading intention results in a lower buying intention. One possible explanation is the price of music CDs. Several interviews were also held to verify our results. Implications and a discussion are then provided.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to evaluate power relations between corporate elites and online music file-sharers on the Web. By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. In doing so, Foucault's work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online \u201cmusic pirates\u201d should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them. Thus, while attempts to curb these online practices and freedoms persist, changes to a discourse guiding trading conditions between the Recording Industry and end-users have been noted, constituting a victory for the latter.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual property piracy is a significant global problem and an enormous problem for U.S. companies and policymakers. This article examines why typically law-abiding people are more inclined to steal intellectual property products than more tangible, material products. The authors propose that the inclination to pay for certain types of goods and services is greater than for other types, and what distinguishes the two classes is their cost structure. They document how consumers are more or less\ninclined to pay for goods and services as a function of whether the product\u2019s cost is principally attributable to variable cost (VC) or fixed cost (FC). The authors\u2019 central thesis is that consumers (1)\nbelieve that they cause less harm if their failure to pay prevents a seller from recovering FC than if their failure to pay helps a seller recoup VC; (2) are more likely to risk not paying for a product the less harm they perceive that not paying would cause; and (3) therefore feel less obligated and are less likely to pay voluntarily for a high-FC, low-VC product than for a high-VC, low-FC product, when total cost and average cost are held constant. This research is particularly relevant in the information age, because it helps explain why consumers appear to be more inclined to risk stealing software and other intellectual property products with relatively high FC and little or no VC. It also allows for the creation of marketing remedies that do not involve further legal enforcement.",

This may help explain why ordinarily law-abiding people are more likely to steal intangible products than material goods.\n\n* Consumers perceive failure to pay for a high-VC product as inflicting greater harm to a seller than failure to pay for a high-FC product. This is because consumers perceive amounts paid in excess of VC as a gain to the seller, and they perceive failure to cover the seller\u2019s VC as inflicting a loss. Consumers are more likely to pay for a product the more harm they believe that not paying would cause.\n\n* This study has implications for consumer perceptions of fair price. Much of what consumers perceive as fair depends on how they believe that prices and a firm\u2019s motive for charging prices affect firm or producer profitability. A price increase without a cost increase raises profits and is considered less fair than is a price increase associated with a cost increase.",

      "abstract": "Recent technological and market forces have profoundly impacted the music industry. Emphasizing threats from peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, the industry continues to seek sanctions against individuals who offer a significant number of songs for others to copy. Combining data on the performance of music albums on the Billboard charts with file sharing data from a popular network, we assess the impact of recent developments related to the music industry on survival of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P sharing on an album\u2019s survival on the charts. In the post-P2P era, we find significantly reduced chart survival except for those albums that debut high on the charts. In addition, superstars and female artists continue to exhibit enhanced survival. Finally, we observe a narrowing of the advantage held by major labels. The second phase of our study isolates the impact of file sharing on album survival. We find that, although sharing does not hurt the survival of top-ranked albums, it does have a negative impact on low-ranked albums. These results point to increased risk from rapid information sharing for all but the \u201ccream of the crop.\u201d",

      "abstract": "Downloading unauthorized music file, being framed as a problem of crime, is deemed unethical, but the peer-to-peer systems have boosted its popularity and have become the killer application for the music industry. Two factors, cost savings from CD purchase and the low moral reasoning ability of Internet users, have been frequently attributed as rationales for this behavior. Music download, however, can also be interpreted as a value maximizing behavior that chooses between the values from consuming illicit and legitimate music, wherein the consumption value is partly dependent on one\u2019s degree of fashion involvement since music is fashionable. This paper presents a conceptual model of music download by looking at and integrating these seldom noticed perspectives with traditional explanations. An analysis of 834 samples drew from a survey of P2P users in Taiwan reveals that: people are maximizing value while downloading music; and that fashion involvement influences the perception of consumption value from music download. This study also found that moral reasoning moderate the relationships among fashion involvement, consumption value, and behavioral intention to download music.",

In this paper we explore the possibility that broad, illegitimate distribution of a digital good might have offsetting effects on the demand for complementary non-digital goods. We examine the impact of file-sharing on sales of recorded music and on the demand for live concert performances. We provide evidence suggesting that while file-sharing reduced album sales, it simultaneously increased demand for concerts. This effect is most pronounced for small artists, perhaps because file-sharing boosts awareness of such artists.

While file-sharing may have substantially displaced album sales, it also facilitated a broader distribution of music, which appears to have expanded awareness of smaller artists and increased demand for their live concert performances. \n\n* Concert revenues for large artists, however, appear to have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. Music for large artists was likely widely available prior to file-sharing, and as a result it is not surprising that demand for those artists\u2019 concerts would have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. \n\n* The decline in album sales is much more pronounced for large artists than for small artists. Large artists\u2019 music may have been more readily available on file-sharing sites, in which case file-sharing would naturally have a bigger impact on large artists. But for small artists, file-sharing may have increased awareness of their music and encouraged some additional album sales from a larger fan base even as it displaced album sales to others. \n\n* While the market for live music appears to expand after Napster, and the market for recorded music contracts, the results imply that large artists lose market share in both markets.\n\n* Given the sharp changes observed over a very short period of time around the entry of Napster, along with the differences in the effects for large vs. small artists, the findings in this paper are more easily explained by file-sharing than by other contemporaneous factors.",

Specifically, does it matter if the source of advice has a stake in the outcome of the piracy decision? Does it matter if the source of advice has a social tie with the advisee? Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen's parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game\u2014The Piracy Game\u2014extended from the volunteer's dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child's behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy. Our analyses not only provide managerial insights but also develop theoretical understanding of the role of social ties in the context of advice.",

The study is among the first to include both parents and their children in a behavioral/experimental economics study.\n\n- Results indicate that when there is a tangible stake for the parent for their child\u2019s actions, purchasing behavior by the child is significantly increased, and pirating behavior is slightly decreased.\n\n- Even when there is not a stake for the parents (e.g., potential litigation), the advice is most effective when the advisor has a stronger social tie (parent as opposed to the record label or a regulator).

Using an original database on BitTorrent file-sharing communities, our article finds a positive relationship between the size of a community and the amount of collective goods provided.

We identified a set of characteristics of P2P networks that could explain the proportion of P2P music compared to Compact Disc (CD) music and we observed on a sample of 4060 Spanish P2P users the impact each of those characteristics had on the CD-purchasing behaviour of these users.

      "abstract": "Using survey data on cultural consumption by about 650 university students, this article proposes a market segmentation and some \"rule-of-thumb\" managerial implications for the music industry. The aim is to show how technological innovation impacts on the structure of consumer preferences. Consumption behaviours, listening habits and musical preferences are explained by a large number of variables. Nevertheless it is possible to reduce this overload of information into two common factors (using \"factor analysis\"). \"Cluster analysis\" is accordingly used to group the students-consumers. The findings are then deepened in light of an econometric analysis. The analysis shows that the new digital technologies (for example \"file sharing\") may be harmful for the music industry only within one specific group of consumers. New technologies can instead promote music consumption (especially of live music) by the other categories of consumers. By investing in music knowledge and enjoyment, it is possible to induce consumers to buy digital music legally from authorized sites.",

Consumers are unwilling to pay more than a trivial amount to download music. Therefore, current pricing schemes for online access are unlikely to reduce SCOURing.\n\n* SCOURing is an entrenched consumer behavior. The most prolific\u2014college-age consumers\u2014grew up sharing files via accessibleP2P networks. As a result, they never or rarely paid for digitised intellectual property; for them, payment would be aberrant. \n\n* The decision to engage in SCOURing is based, at least partly, on beliefs about the behaviours of important others. Consistent with social learning theory, this research suggests peer influence relates positively to SCOURing.\n\n* Motivation (justification, peer influence, and believed risklessness) and ability (tech-savviness) as antecedents to SCOURing suggest why anti-SCOURing legal remedies were impotent and customer alienating. \n\n* If people act in a difficult-to-monitor way believed acceptable to other people, then efforts to coerce anyone to act otherwise is futile.",

It examines the moderating role of past downloading behavior on the relationship between anticipated guilt/emotions and intentions, which has not been examined in the illegal downloading context, by casting light on the means and standard deviations of guilt and general emotions among those who engaged in digital piracy and among those who rarely or never downloaded on both the emotional and cognitive variables. More specifically, this article shows that: \n\n* Demographic variables, such as gender, race, and residential status, did not predict intentions to download in the next 2 months and were not included in the final results. Past behavior was a significant predictor of intentions, showing that those who downloaded in the past 6 months were more likely to download in the future than those who did not.\n\n* Those who downloaded had higher intentions to download than those who never downloaded or who downloaded 6 months ago.\n\n* Unlike anticipated guilt, which only predicts intentions for the downloaders, anticipated general emotions predict intentions to engage in illegal downloading for the whole sample. Thus, the influence of these positive general emotions does not depend on the appraisal of previous events or previous behavior.",

First, the present study is designed to provide additional information about the link between off-line and virtual peers and music piracy. Second, the present study provides information about how off-line and virtual peers interact with self-control to understand music piracy. The results of this study show that low self-control has a link with digital piracy. This means that individuals who cannot resist temptation and do not see the consequences of their action have an increased likelihood to perform digital piracy, which is consistent with a growing literature in this area (Higgins et al. 2006; Higgins and Makin 2004a, 2004b; Higgins and Wilson 2006).",

This study obtained college student responses to scenarios that measured perceptions of three types of music theft: shoplifting a CD, illegally downloading, and illegally downloading plus file sharing. The students also reported their own recent downloading behavior, completed a demographics questionnaire, and responded to a series of statements that assessed their attitudes regarding factors associated with legal compliance in other domains. The data indicated that students viewed downloading and file sharing very differently than they viewed shoplifting in terms of endorsement of reasons to comply with laws prohibiting those behaviors. Further, concerns regarding punishment (i.e. deterrence), morality beliefs, and generalized obligation to obey the rule of law had the strongest relationships to self-reported downloading behavior.

Music file sharing has been deemed illegal in many countries and is quite detrimental to record labels around the world. The music industry is looking for a business model that would let it tap into the new mode of file-sharing consumption. Until now music file-sharing behavior has not been systematically analyzed in the literature. This paper presents an analytical framework by looking at music file-sharing behavior from the perspectives of moral judgment, expertise, and social networking, and then presents a conceptual model of sharing through a set of hypotheses. An empirical study based on the model provides in-depth insights into sharing behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications and further research possibilities.",

The results support the theoretical and empirical efficacy of the proposed model and highlight the importance of attitudes toward the act of digital piracy, the frequency of past digital piracy behaviors, and the motivations and intentions underlying digital piracy. A normative framework is proposed with five actionable recommendations to assist digital service marketers in better addressing digital piracy.

      "abstract": "Online piracy of copyrighted digital music has become rampant as Internet bandwidth and digital compression technologies have advanced. The music industry has suffered significant financial losses and has responded with lawsuits, although online music piracy remains prevalent. This article developed a research model to study the determinants of individual intentions to commit online music piracy. The model was derived from the theories of planned behavior and deterrence. A survey questionnaire of 216 respondents was used to test the model. Consistent with the theory of planned behavior, the results showed that attitude toward online music piracy, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant antecedent factors of intention to commit online music piracy. Concerning deterrence theory, the results suggest that the effect of perceived punishment severity on attitude was highly significant for females, and the effect of perceived certainty of punishment on attitude was not significant for males or females.",

Two commonly used software products, Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, were used in the study as objects to reveal consumer assessed values. A consumer survey was administered in Taiwan and the total valid samples were 799. Respondents in this study included students from senior high schools, colleges, and graduate schools, and general consumers who were no longer full-time students. The estimated average WTP for Windows was USD 58.55 and for Office was USD 53.49, much lower than the respective suggested retail prices in the market. Social norms had strong positive influences on willingness-to-pay for software products. The prosecution risk did not significantly increase WTPs for software products due to the reason that individuals who used pirated software were not at a high risk of being prosecuted. Performance risk was positively correlated to WTPs for software products. The respondents segmented into the low-WTP cluster were more likely to use pirated software than those in the high- WTP segment. Source reliability, legitimacy, technical support, and customer service were emphasized in decisions of respondents in the high-WTP segment and could be used in marketing strategies.",

      "abstract": "Recently user-oriented online sharing communities have seen explosive growth. Two characteristics of these communities set them apart from traditional online message-based communities such as online forums. First, users have no social ties before joining the community. Second, there is little or no \"verbal\" communication between users. This research investigates the structure and dynamics of online sharing communities using data collected from an IRC music channel from 2001 to 2006, covering all five years of the post-Napster age. We have collected more than three hundred million individual activities, capturing 0.05% of the global music sharing volume. We find that sharers are an essential part of the community and their activities have a dominant impact on the growth of the community. By contrast, free riders have two opposite impacts on sharer retention. More free riders in number make it more likely for a sharer to keep sharing, while more free rider activities discourage sharers from contributing. That is, the existence of free riders, despite the congestion caused by their download activities, does to some degree stabilize the community. Most previous literature examines the online community only from the aggregate level. Our study, nevertheless, distinguish the influence and behavior of different members in the community. Instead of paying only attention to the total number of users, our results suggest that understanding the impact of their core members is critical in investigating the dynamics and the sustainability of online sharing communities.",

Moreover, the more sharers are involved in a community, the more likely the sharers continue to contribute content.\n* Fee riders\u2019 are at the exact opposites in retaining sharers; the more free rider download activities, the more likely a sharer will stop sharing. \n* Sharer size is responsible for both sharer gain and loss.

Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, we hypothesize that knowledge of software piracy promoted by these campaigns will lead to increased awareness of the legal consequences of engaging in software piracy and the likelihood of being punished. These two constructs, in turn, will impact on one\u2019s attitude towards software piracy, and hence, on the level of one\u2019s pirating behavior. We test the model using a sample of U.S. business students and find strong support for the model, with an understanding of the number of jobs lost due to software piracy being the dominant factor. This suggests that decision makers in the software industry need to refocus educational outreach programs from stressing the illegality of copyright infringement to emphasizing the social consequences of such behavior.",

The authors assess the tendency to pirate with both indirect measures (e.g., willingness to pay for the legal alternative) and direct measures (e.g., piracy preference). Whether measured indirectly or directly, the tendency to pirate depends, to different extents, on three key factors: positive incentives (e.g., improved functionality of the legal Web site), negative incentives (e.g., perceived risk of piracy), and consumer characteristics. Based on three studies, the results suggest that negative incentives are a strong deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy tendencies for others. Conversely, positive incentives, such as improved functionality, can significantly reduce the tendency to pirate among all the consumer segments studied.

Although previous studies propose several antipirating strategies, they do not discuss how to enhance customer intentions to use legal software, which is crucial for software companies. The authors provide four generic retention strategies developed from both antipiracy and customer loyalty literature. The results indicate lower-pricing, legal, communication, and product strategies all enhance customer purchase intentions toward legal software. The lower-pricing strategy is more useful for stayers and dissatisfied switchers, and the communication strategy is most useful for dissatisfied switchers. Both the legal and product strategies have similar impacts on purchase intentions across the three segments. From a firm perspective, a product strategy is most worthwhile and useful across all segments.",

      "abstract": "Theft of software and other intellectual property has become one of the most visible problems in computing today. This paper details the development and empirical validation of a model of software piracy by individuals in the workplace. The model was developed from the results of prior research into software piracy, and the reference disciplines of the theory of planned behavior, expected utility theory, and deterrence theory. A survey of 201 respondents was used to test the model. The results indicate that individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant precursors to the intention to illegally copy software. In addition, punishment severity, punishment certainty, and software cost have direct effects on the individual\u2019s attitude toward software piracy, whereas punishment certainty has a significant effect on perceived behavioral control. Consequently, strategies to reduce software piracy should focus on these factors. The results add to a growing stream of information systems research into illegal software copying behavior and have significant implications for organizations and industry groups aiming to reduce software piracy.",

A laboratory experiment with 54 subjects was conducted, in which each subject was told to participate in a software quality evaluation exercise. However, a ploy was carried out to measure the subjects\u2019 intention in software piracy under different levels of group pressure and financial gains. The results are interesting. On the intention of softlifting, both group pressure and financial gains are significant determinants. The interaction of group pressure and financial gains is also significant: when group pressure is toward pirating software, financial gains is not a relevant factor; whereas when group pressure is toward purchasing, financial gains becomes a dominant factor in softlifting intention. A further survey (with 216 college students from two public universities in Taiwan) designed to investigate the relationship between consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (Bearden et al., 1989) and softlifting intention/behavior. A path analysis demonstrated that normative influence was related to softlifting intention, yet information influence effect was marginal. The effect of normative influence on softlifting behavior was mainly mediated by softlifting intention. Implications are also discussed.",

We develop a structural model and test it using survey data from a prime demographic set of respondents who engage in music piracy. Considering behavioral heterogeneity, we employ a factor mixture modeling technique to classify respondents into different groups that highlight distinct patterns of social learning influences. We find that the differential effects of social learning factors on obtaining and sharing persist across these groups. We further utilize demographic variables to profile members in each group for segmentation insights.

By the constructions of a theoretical framework, we are able to explain the relationship between income distributions and software piracy rates. Our research suggests that the proportion of the population with positive net benefits from piracy increases with income inequality at a diminishing rate, and then eventually decreases. We provide empirical evidence for this inverted U-shaped relationship between income inequality and piracy rates, while controlling for income, judicial efficiency, and fixed broadband subscribers. Our theoretical and empirical results imply that lax anti-piracy policies would make software producers better off (i.e., higher software sales because of network effects) in countries whose income inequality is moderate, but worse off in countries whose income inequality is severe.

      "abstract": "This article presents findings from the first large-scale quantitative assessment of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) exchanges of copyrighted material on a college campus based on actual observation. Through passive monitoring and deep packet inspection (DPI), we assess the extent to which P2P is used to transfer copyrighted material. We also characterize the demographics of P2P users, the relative popularity of the material, and how the burden on the campus network varies over time. We found that at least 51% of students living on campus engaged in P2P, at least 42% attempted to transfer copyrighted material, and the mean number of copyrighted media titles whose transfer is attempted per week was at least 6 per monitored student. Some students use P2P legally, e.g. to transfer Linux software or non-copyrighted adult material, but we found no evidence that large numbers of students use P2P for these legal purposes and not to transfer copyrighted material. Students of all genders, ages, classes and majors engaged in file sharing, to the extent that demographics were not helpful in identifying likely file-sharers so as to target interventions. This study also provides lessons for those who would use DPI technology to reduce illegal use of P2P. If given enough weeks to observe, current technology is effective at identifying users who attempt to transfer copyrighted material, provided that their traffic is identifiable as P2P. Thus, DPI can be used to estimate the extent of piracy, and to notify individuals who may be violating copyright law. However, encryption is available and can be easily activated in most P2P clients. Once turned on, encryption prevents DPI from detecting whether transferred material is copyrighted, rendering it ineffective. If DPI is used for copyright enforcement that includes imposition of penalties, then P2P users or P2P developers may have the incentive to use encryption as a way of evading detection.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: \n\n*The study employs two experiments to examine the effectiveness of various strategies used to dissuade consumers from downloading music illegally. The research investigates two specific strategies that the recording industry has used: (1) fear or threat appeals (e.g., the threat of punishment, such as fines and/or jail time), and (2) attribution of harm (informing consumers of the harm caused by the illegal downloading of music, such as financial loss to either the artist or the recording company). The study also considers whether past illegal downloading behaviour reduces the effectiveness of these disincentive strategies. Finally, the impact of subjective norms (i.e., whether subjects think their friends would approve of downloading music) was also investigated.\n\n*Findings indicate a significant effect of threat appeal such that stronger threat appeals were found to be more effective than weaker threat appeals in reducing illegal downloading. The first study also showed that prior illegal downloading behavior does not curtail the effects of threat appeals aimed at reducing illegal downloading. In addition, results reveal no differences in downloading behavior in terms of attribution of harm deterrent strategy (harm to either the recording artist or company). The most interesting finding from the second study is that subjective norms appear to equalize low versus high past downloaders, but only under conditions of weak fear.\n\n*The current manuscript is the first to examine the impact of four different variables (threat appeals, attribution of harm, subjective norms, and previous downloadingbehavior) on subjects\u2019 likelihood to illegally download music in the future. In particular, this research illuminates the potential importance of social norms in discouraging a type of undesirable consumer behavior but shows that this occurs only under a restricted set of conditions: when threat is low and the consumer is not a habitually high downloader. It should be of interest to those in fields where intellectual property can be pirated on the Internet.",

It is quite possible that college students, who are typically not yet financially independent, have a hard time believing that music artists and/or companies truly need the money that is lost due to downloading music. \n\n*The most interesting finding from study two was that social norms have a significant impact on future downloading behavior. In other words, college students do care what others think about them downloading songs without paying.\n\n*In particular, this research illuminates the potential importance of social norms in discouraging a type of undesirable consumer behavior but shows that this occurs only under a restricted set of conditions: when threat is low and the consumer is not a habitually high downloader.\n\n*For these consumers, the extra incentive of doing what others think is \u2018cool\u2019 compensates for low levels of threat but not for higher levels of threat. Current theories concerning the role of social norms in curbing undesirable forms of consumer behavior must consider the moderating role of factors like past behavioral patterns.",

      "abstract": "This study focuses on one of the newer forms of software piracy, known as digital piracy, and uses the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework to attempt to determine factors that influence digital piracy (the illegal copying/downloading of copyrighted software and media files). This study examines factors, which could determine an individual\u2019s intention to pirate digital material (software, media, etc.). Past piracy behavior and moral obligation, in addition to the prevailing theories of behavior (Theory of Planned Behavior), were studied to determine the influence on digital piracy intention. Based on the results of this study, planned behavioral factors in addition to past piracy behavior and moral obligation were found to influence an individual\u2019s intention to pirate digital material. Attitude, past piracy behavior, perceived behavior control, and moral obligation explained 71 percent of the intention to pirate variance. Using these results, a better understanding of why individuals pirate is presented and can be used to help combat digital piracy.",

CD burners are available at very reasonable prices and blank CDs are even cheaper than computer floppy disks. One option is to increase the cost/supply of these resources needed for piracy. By increasing the cost of piracy and decreasing the cost of the digital material, digital piracy can be combated effectively.\n\n*Since students have access to high-speed internet at their universities, a complete Hollywood movie can be downloaded in less than 30 minutes. Many universities are now employing high-end firewalls to prevent the illegal trading of digital media. The next step would be to target ISPs and software makers (that create these file-swapping programs) to curb digital piracy.\n\n*Many subjects didn\u2019t feel a great deal of guilt about pirating digital media; that it was acceptable behavior. There was a low level of guilt (moral obligation) towards digital piracy. To combat this, society has to be informed of how harmful piracy is. One method is the use of targeted ads like the ones targeting smoking in young teenagers. \n\n*Another method is the use of advertisements in movie theatres explaining how piracy affects the motion picture industry as well as individuals that are a part of the industry. Different harmful aspects of piracy should be presented to consumers in the public opinion court. Examples of appropriate behavior must be emphasized. \n\n*Another way would be to enforce newer ethical codes of conduct for information systems professional that stress different types of piracy (not just software) and its effect on business and society as a whole.",

This suggests that subjects who have previously pirated digital material have a higher intention to pirate in the future, especially as the frequency of pirating increases. 76.5% of the subjects in this study have previously pirated. \n\n*The differences between males and females subjects with respect to past piracy behavior is noted. Of those who have not pirated digital material, 36.4% were men and 63.6% were women. Of those who have pirated digital material in the past, 65.1% were men and 34.9% were women. \n\n*Moral obligation also had a large effect on the intention to pirate digital material. Subjects who felt more guilt or moral obligation toward digital piracy have a lower intention to pirate. 50.7% of the subjects felt more guilt or moral obligation that pirating was not right, while 23.6% felt pirating was alright and acceptable behavior. \n\n*When comparing men and women, both groups felt that pirating was not right (54% and 46.5%, respectively).\n\n*Perceived behavioral control (PBC) also had an effect on the intention to pirate. Subjects who have the skills and resources to pirate digital media have a higher intention of pirate digital media. 84.3% of the subjects reported that it was easy or very easy to pirate digital media, and only 0.3% found it hard or very hard to pirate. In response to this high PBC, it is also interesting to note that the music and movie industries have been making pirating much more difficult to accomplish.\n\n*Attitude was not the best predictor of intention in terms of explained variance (as was the case in previous studies). This could be a result of the high correlation between attitude and moral obligation (r = 0.6481). \n\n*43.9% of the subjects indicated a more favorable attitude toward digital piracy, while 23.6% had a less favorable attitude and 32.5% neutral. \n\n*It is also noted that subjective norms was not significant in the extended TPB piracy intention model.",

Specifically, software piracy is becoming economically devastating to companies that develop and market software. Some researchers have argued that the level of moral intensity regarding software piracy of individuals may be related to the extent of actual software piracy behaviour. In order to empirically study this relationship, it is important to understand the concept of moral intensity towards software piracy. In this research, we study the concept in an international setting, a university in Thailand. We report the relationship between moral intensity and some important demographic variables and also explore the relationship between moral intensity of individuals and the perceived moral intensity of their community, the students, employees, and faculty.

      "abstract": "The report \u201cCirculations of Culture. Social Distribution of Content\u201d is an attempt at \nanalyzing the phenomenon of informal cultural content sharing in Poland. It describes \nhow books, music, and movies circulate among Poles who sometimes buy them, but more often than not acquire them via the Internet and borrow or copy them from friends. We focused our study on the comparison of formal and informal circulations of cultural content, in the form of either digital or cultural copies. We decided not to \nstudy broadcast media use, due to the lack of circulating copies that allow comparisons with informal circulations online. \nYet the public discussion, revolving around file sharing networks and more broadly \naround obtaining and making use of cultural content in a digital form, usually situates these practices on the margin of typical activities of Poles. Such practices still seem to be \u2013as they are described in the public discussion- an embarrassing subject; stigmatized as an illegal activity that hurts legal content markets, creators, and intermediaries. \nWe conducted this research study in order to provide this public debate with an \nempirically absed descriptuon of the circulations of content in digital form and \nforemost on the Internet. And also to show the cultural and social aspects of this \nphenomenon that go beyond the question of its legality. First and foremost, we seek \nto explain why informal circulations of culture in digital form are an important issue for research on contemporary culture. Secondly, we stress that exploration into this issue provides important evidence for cultural policy.\nThe goal of our project was purely exploratory \u2013 instead of making rigid assumptionsin order to verify them, we decided to analyze the answers that the respondents put down in the questionnaires, their attitudes, and the opinions they expressed. This approach sought to help us understand how often, in what way, and why \nPoles engage with informal content circulations. \nMost importantly, we chose not to distinguish nor discriminate between legal and\nillegal circulations \u2013 mainly because the border between the two is often fuzzy and \nunclear for people who participate in either of them. Therefore, this is not a report \nabout \u201cpirates\u201d that conduct illegal activities, but rather about people who engage in informal content sharing practices. \nBut abandoning the simple legal-illegal binary has yet another reason. The goal of this report is to foster real dialogue on the issue of acquiring cultural content in Poland. The overuse of labels such as \u201cpiracy\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d will not improve the chances of establishing such dialogue. An opposition between \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinformal\u201d is in our opinion a much better way for framing this debate.\nWe conducted a quantitative, survey study and one of our primary goal was to \nestablish the scale and general character of the informal content circulation \u2013\nespecially the distribution of digital formats. The project consisted of two surveys. The first one, a pilot survey, was conducted through computer-assisted personal \ninterviews between May 19 and May 26 of 2011 on a sample of 1004 people over 15 \nyears of age, which was representative for the Polish population. \nThe goal of this survey was to describe the scale and basic characteristics of informal circulation in the whole Polish society. We were in particular interested in differences between Internet users and non-users, and between age groups. \nThe second survey was conducted over the Internet through computer-assisted web interviewson a sample of 1283 people. The survey was conducted on a random \nnationwide sample and the demographic structure of the analyzed set was representative of the Polish Internet user population (according to Nettrack) with \nrespect to gender, age (16 to 50 years old), place of residence, and education. \nWe have focused upon the population of Internet users based on the results of the first survey, according to which non-users do not participate in circulations of digital content.",

If we do, then we will arrive at the conclusion that this substitution is furthered not only by the negatively-branded Internet phenomena, but also by the commonplace sharing of  content in the household, and even the activity of public cultural institutions, the latter also enabling us to access content via non-market means. \n\n*We\u2019re already facing situations where access to content that\u2019s allowed from the standpoint of the Polish legal system is hindered by technological instruments. The state, with its instruments that are supposed to regulate that sphere, has to look for balance between the interest of copyright owners and the public good. Favoring either side of the issue is completely unacceptable. \n\n*Cultural policy should be based on the assumption that multiple content circulations can coexist and might frequently overlap. And the goal of cultural policy should be the establishment of institutions and cultural frameworks that will harness these various circulations to foster creativity, as well as the possibility to use it, while remaining grounded in facts and considering the arguments of all involved parties.",

      "proposition": "Principal conclusions of the report:\n\n*13% of Poles purchase content, as opposed to 33% that obtain it through informal, digital circulations. Only 13% of Poles have purchased a book, a movie, or a musical recording in the year before the survey. Informal circulation is the second source of cultural content with the broadcast mass media like radio and TV being the first. The informal sphere covers 39% of Poles \u2013 thus being three times as large as the market-bound circulation of cultural content. \n\n*Engaging with the informal circulations of digital content strongly correlates with age. We should assume that populations ages 40 and older do not participate in smaller circulation of digital content.\n\n*The survey did not corroborate the thesis about informal circulations supplanting the formal ones. The people who most actively engage in the informal content circulations (i.e. Internet users who download files) constitute the largest segment of the purchasers. They comprise 32% of all people purchasing books, 31% of all people purchasing movies, and over half of all people who buy music. The 15 to 24 age group made up the biggest part of the group of people that both purchase content and download it from the Internet \u2013 despite common assumptions that younger generations lack funds to purchase content. \n\n*A quarter of all Poles engage with the informal circulation without purchasing any content from the formal circulations. Membership in this group is strongly linked  with age \u2013 the percentage of such people is much higher in the younger age groups,  while significantly dropping off in age groups over 50. \n\n*62% of Poles do not participate in either the formal or the informal circulations of cultural content. The primary form of cultural activity for most Poles is probably watching television and listening to the radio. \n\n*The average Internet user buys three times more books and movies and seven times more music in comparison with people who don\u2019t use the Internet. Internet usage is the primary distinguishing factor when it comes to interest in cultural content, which is furthercorrelated with age and education. More importantly, these differences are even more pronounced where accessing content doesn\u2019t require any financial commitment, such as borrowing books, movies, or music. \n\n*Active Internet users are a group especially inclined to participate in circulations of culture. Strong differences are revealed when Internet users are split into less active and more active ones: 88% of active Internet users participate in the informal circulation of music, 73% participate in informal book circulation, and 78% engage in informal movie circulation (in the three months preceding the survey). 72% of active internet users claim to have downloaded files from the Internet \u2013 e.g. from file-sharing networks or from file hosting services. \n\n*92% of active users claim to have engaged in informal circulations if their definition is expanded to include all avenues of content access (such as streaming, sharing files with friends, etc.). If we include the informal circulation of content stored on physical media (e.g. sharing and copying books or CDs and DVDs) in the aforementioned definition, then practically all of the respondents (95%) claim to have engaged in such content circulations. \n\n*75% of active internet users indicated price and a wider selection of content available on the Internet as justifications for their behavior.

      "abstract": "Softlifting, or the illegal duplication of copyrighted software by individuals for personal use, is a serious and costly problem for software developers and distributors. Understanding the factors that determine attitude toward softlifting is important in order to ascertain what motivates individuals to engage in the behavior. We examine a number of factors, including personal moral obligation (PMO), perceived usefulness, and awareness of the laws and regulations governing software acquisition and use, along with facets of personal self-identity that may play a role in the development of attitudes and therefore intentions regarding this behavior. These factors are examined across multiple settings expected to be pertinent to our survey respondents: home, work and school. Personal moral obligation and perceived usefulness are significant predictors of attitude across all settings. Past behavior is a significant predictor of intention across all settings, and a significant predictor of attitude in the home setting. We find evidence that awareness of the law causes a less favorable evaluation of softlifting in the school setting only, but has little effect in the home and work settings. As in previous studies, attitude is a significant predictor of intent. We do not find indications that one's personal self-identity influences one's attitude towards the behavior and the intention to perform it, except in the case of legal identity, where marginally significant effects are found in the work environment.",

Prior research suggests that the moral component is an integral part of attitude and the empirical data strongly support this claim.\n\n*Risk-taking personal identity is positively related to one's attitude toward softlifting. However, this relationship is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the school setting. \n\n*Gender was not a significant factor in any setting. Previous research finds that males had a more favorable attitude towards software piracy than females, and suggests that one possible explanation might be that males were greater risk-takers. This study finds evidence to support the explanation offered by those prior studies.\n\n*Legal personal identity is negatively related to one's attitude toward softlifting but this relation is only moderately significant (a = 0.10), and only in the work setting. The ability to detect this effect may be limited by the single-item measure used in this study. Nonetheless, the results support the expectation of a negative effect of legal personal identity on attitude; this seems a promising avenue for further research.\n\n*Awareness of the law is significant in reducing a favorable attitude toward softlifting, but only at school, where a student runs a greater risk of loss of privileges or a blemish on his or her record.\n\n*The research model is able to explain over 60% of the variance in attitude toward softlifting in all settings. Prior studies involving the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model have shown that attitude is an important determinant of behavioral intention. \n\n*It is therefore important to understand the determinants of attitude in order to comprehend the reasons that such behavior exists. This model demonstrates that with a behavior that has a moral component (such as softlifting), personal moral attitude and legal personal identity are important in explaining attitude toward the behav- ior. \n\n*Additionally, perceived usefulness is significant as well. This model could possibly be useful in predicting other behaviors that include a strong moral component.\n\n*In addition to significant findings regarding the determinants of attitude toward softlifting, this research shows that when examining software piracy behavior, setting matters. Future research along these lines could produce intriguing results.",

We investigate whether a corporate pledge to donate a portion of profits to a charitable cause will decrease the extent to which customers illegally obtain that company's products. Donations to charitable causes may increase the moral intensity of piracy (robbing the poor rather than robbing the rich) and consequently may reduce the willingness to pirate. This rationale is empirically tested through a dual empirical strategy, that is, a market survey and a laboratory experiment. We show that market piracy decreases when a very low or very high donation mechanism is implemented. Nevertheless, for intermediate levels of transfer, piracy increases again.",

The sample is gender-balanced with 48% female and 52% male, with a mean age of 21 years. The survey was based on a 40-item questionnaire related to music piracy and individual characteristics. The survey was conducted on a face-to-face basis.\n\nThe experiment was a standard public good game. The experimental market was composed of two types of participants: consumers and record producers. The experiment was completely decontextualized: endowments, profits and donations were printed on different colored tickets, and no reference was made to CDs or donations. At the beginning of the experiment, all agents received an endowment in colored tickets.\nThese colored tickets were exchanged for money at the end of the experiment following a set of rules.\nEach consumer was given yellow tickets. Half of the \u201cconsumers\u201d were given a large endowment and the other half a (very) low endowment. Each record producer was given red tickets. An official exchange rate (yellow tickets into red tickets) was given and all rules were made public to the participants. We focused on \u201cconsumer\u201d behavior\nin this experimental market. The consumers had to exchange their yellow tickets for red tickets. Red tickets held by \u201cconsumers\u201d at the end of each session were exchanged for real money at a 1-to-1 basis (1 red ticket = 1 euro). The record producers had to exchange their red tickets for yellow tickets. Each yellow ticket held by a \u201cproducer\u201d at the end of a session was exchanged for .66 euro. The sessions were organized as follows: 21 participants were involved in a session. The experiment took place in two different rooms (A and B). The participants were split into two groups, 20 consumers were in room A and one producer was in room B. \nThree sessions (one per treatment) were conducted with 63 participants in April 2006 in the Business School of Burgundy in Dijon. Participants were students in various fields and at various levels in schools and universities of Dijon. They received a show-up fee of 5 euro (s= 5) and the money earned during the experiment. The experiment lasted 45 min and participants earned between 5 euro and 25 euro.",

Meanwhile, collectivistic and individualistic cultural components are found to coexist in the Chinese value system. The users with higher scores in the collectivistic component have more negative attitudes towards software companies, while the users with higher scores in the individualistic component have less negative attitudes towards software products.

As far as price is concerned, no company can compete against \u201cfree.\u201d Hence, managers, researchers, and policy makers are interested in determining factors other than price that might influence consumers\u2019 file sharing behavior. Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers\u2019 perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities. We find the relationships are significant even when controlling for several other elements such as gender, age, income, and prior knowledge about how and where to go on the internet to participate in file sharing.",

Respondents were part of an online survey panel that is a representative sample of American adults. Access was aquired through Qualtrics.com.

Further research is needed to more clearly establish what the boundaries are for restrictiveness of use.\n\n*Industry practitioners attempting to develop campaigns based on the results contained in this article should be aware that research has found that consumers more often follow social norms rather than requests from corporations. this should have some bearing on the design of advertising campaigns.\n\n*Consumers\u2019 restrictiveness judgments appear to be compounded by notions of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201clocation\u201d. That is, while most consumers believe in something like the hypernorm \u201cthou shalt not steal,\" stealing, as an activity, becomes increasingly fuzzy in intellectual property rights that are (for the most part) bound by time and location (i.e., geography).\n\n*A more-effective approach to limiting file sharing is to educate people about how much they are really sharing and with whom they are really sharing.",

That is, the perceived restrictiveness of a transfer (i.e., streaming a song online versus listening to a tangible CD) affected consumers\u2019 ethical and legal stances. \n\n*This suggests that many consumers may feel they are acting consistently with their ethical and legal views when they participate in forms of unauthorized file sharing because they do not \u201csee\u201d a \u201cphysical\u201d transfer of property rights. \n\n*Variation in ethical and legal perceptions arises not only between individuals, but also between circumstances.\n\n*Not only are more consumers likely to view situations that are more restrictive as ethical, but they are more likely to participate in those situations.",

To this end we rely on a survey comprising behavior and attitudes at the individual level. The sample matches some demographic characteristics of the German population with high-speed internet access with regard to gender and age composition. It also maps the share of foreign nationals in Germany. Self-selection in the drawing of our sample is assessed by a control experiment. In contrast to existing studies, we sharply discriminate between frequency and extent of pirating digital media. We find no significant gender difference in the propensity to pirate. However, male individuals are prone to pirate at a significantly larger scale.We attribute this finding to male individuals acting more frequently as hubs in the social prestige enhancing distribution of pirated media. It is particularly important in the light of the recent development of the distribution process from peer-to-peer online networks to offline forms of file swapping.

In a multiple regression analysis, downloading activity was found to be positively related to deficient self-regulation and the expected social outcomes of downloading behavior. Downloading activity was lessened by dissatisfaction with poor quality downloads. Those who are willing to discontinue downloading are motivated by fear of punishment, but skilled and habitual downloaders were unlikely to discontinue. Normative beliefs also affected downloading. The perception that downloading was morally unacceptable was positively related to intentions to discontinue downloading, while beliefs that the behavior was morally acceptable were positively related to current downloading activity.",

Initial attempts to control online file sharing have been primarily through consumer education and legal action against the operators of networks that facilitated file sharing. Recent legal action against individual file sharers marked an unprecedented shift in the industry\u2019s strategy. The focus now is on well\u2010publicized legal threats and actions on a relatively small group of individuals to discourage overall music file sharing. To determine the resulting impact of these legal threats, we passively tracked online file\u2010sharing behavior of over 2,000 individuals. We found that individuals who share a substantial number of music files react to legal threats differently from those who share a lesser number of files. Importantly, our analysis indicates that even after these legal threats and the resulting lowered levels of file sharing, the availability of music files on these networks remains substantial.",

In fact, digital music service (DMS), the industry that sells MP3 songs, has seen tremendous successes and is making hundreds of millions of dollars every year. However, few attempts have been made to understand the consumption behavior of this newly emerging market because it has its own characteristics that have made other behavioral models inapplicable. In this study, we surveyed college students, who are the most active in this market, concerning their DMS subscription behavior. A modified theory of planned behavior (TPB) model was used as the framework. This new model incorporates the technology acceptance model and a new construct, the perceived service quality, into the original TPB model. Based on the survey results, the present study depicts a model that explains subscription behavior and indicates that subjective norm has the most significant effect on the intention to subscribe. Also, features that potential subscribers found important are revealed. The results provide marketing implications for DMS providers and indicate possible direction for future studies.",

Survey methodology was used to determine the respondents\u2019 perceived likelihood of\npurchasing legitimate CDs depending on the free availability of the same music via a streaming\nservice or downloading on the Internet. In the pre-study, several factors affecting consumer\npurchasing were identified based on the responses of 106 university students.

In addition, this paper examined how the effects of price and\nnon-price factors such as rating of singer, preference for genre, number of songs on a CD, SES\nfactors, and music consumption style may change in the \u201cfree\u201d vs. \u201cnon-free\u201d Internet\navailability conditions. The results showed that there was a weak pattern of interaction between\nprice and free music availability, though the interaction effect was not significant. In the non-free Internet availability situation, price along with some other factors had significant effects on consumer purchasing patterns for some CDs, whereas in the free Internet availability situation, price had insignificant effects on a consumer\u2019s willingness to purchase all twelve CDs used in the questionnaire.

The territoriality of the copyright regime is often perceived as an obstacle that induces geographical segmentation. This paper provides empirical evidence on the extent of market segmentation in the EU on the supply and demand side and measures the contribution of several drivers of this market segmentation. We use data from the Apple iTunes country stores in 27 EU Member States to measure geographical market segmentation in supply (availability), demand (sales) and prices across the EU for downloadable digital music and film. We find that availability of EU media products across country stores in the EU is hovering around 80% for music and 40% for films. Recent industry initiatives to reduce the transaction costs of making digital music available across borders have resulted in a reasonably wide availability though still short of the 100% mark. Consumer preference variables such as cultural proximity, a shared language or border and inherent preferences for home market products are the main drivers for the observed geographical market segmentation in demand patterns, both for music and film. Supply side factors including copyright-related trade costs probably still play a role in music though we can only infer this indirectly in the absence of data on copyright licensing arrangements at product level. Commercial strategies and territorial restrictions in distribution agreements reduce film availability, more so than copyright issues. We also find evidence of price differentiation across iTunes EU country stores.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual property law is caught in a widespread debate over whether it should serve incentive or natural rights objectives, and what the best means for achieving those ends are. This article reports a series of experiments revealing that these debates are actually orthogonal to how most users and many creators understand intellectual property law. The most common perception of intellectual property among the American public is that intellectual property law is designed to prevent plagiarism.\n\nThe plagiarism fallacy in intellectual property law is not an innocuous misperception. This fallacy likely helps explain pervasive illegal infringing activity on the Internet, common dismissal of copyright warnings, and other previously puzzling behavior. The received wisdom has been that the public is ethically dismissive or indifferent towards intellectual property rights. This research reveals instead that experts have failed to comprehend what the public\u2019s conception of intellectual property law actually is.\n\nThe studies reported here uncover several additional intellectual property law findings, including that: (1) the majority of the American public views intellectual property rights as too broad and too strong, (2) knowledge of intellectual property law does not affect opinions about what the law should be, and (3) there are significant demographic and cultural divides concerning intellectual property rights. The findings as a whole raise central questions concerning the public legitimacy of intellectual property law, and consequently its ability to function as intended.",

It assesses the changes in documentary production practice around clearance of copyrighted material since the creation of the Documentary Filmmakers\u2019 Statement of Best Practices in fair use in 2005. Fair use, an exotic and occasional feature of documentary film in 2004, has become well-known and commonly employed. Creative options for filmmakers concerning use of third-party material have dramatically improved with changes in norms after the issuing of the Statement. Attitudes about fair use are strongly associated with free expression and creative opportunity, and vary with experience. Where filmmakers have changed work because of copyright concerns, they themselves rather than any gatekeeper have made the decision to do so. Where change is associated with fair use, risk is a common concern. Newer filmmakers are more likely to support use of copyrighted material to make new work, but less likely to know about fair use, and also more likely to have experienced takedowns online. Both education about and experience with fair use appear to have an effect on practice. Filmmakers continue to lack reliable information on the actual risk landscape, and about fair use on digital platforms.",

      "abstract": "The status of parody and related derivative works within the UK copyright framework lacks clarity and has been recommended for further policy study in two recent independent reviews: the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property in 2006 and the more recent Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth published in 2011.  \n\nThe review documents highlight the dual importance of parodic works both as a form of cultural expression and as a potential source of innovation and growth. A key recommendation made by Hargreaves is that the Government create a new fair dealing copyright exception for parody. However, a shortage of empirical data renders policy intervention in this area difficult. The issue is complicated by the inherently creative nature of parody, ambiguity about its definition and the multiplicity of \neconomic and legal approaches that may be applied. \n\nIn December 2011, following a call to tender procedure, the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) commissioned the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management (CIPPM) at Bournemouth University to undertake research into the potential effects for rightsholders, creators and audiences of introducing a copyright exception for Parody in the UK. This synopsis reports the key findings from two complementary studies carried out by the researchers. Study I presents new empirical data about the rate and nature of parody content production on the online video platform YouTube, and its impact on commercial exploitation of original works where they can be considered to be part of the same market.  Study II distils regulatory options for a parody exception from a comparative review of seven jurisdictions. \n\nThe current synopsis document contains three parts. First, it discusses the empirical findings from Study I. A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011. Secondly, this synopsis presents a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven  jurisdictions  that  have  implemented  or  are  considering  implementing  a  copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying  principles  (including  economic  and  constitutional)  governing  divergent  legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented. Thirdly, this synopsis document provides a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data. Each of the policy options identified in Study II is examined for its likely impact on the empirical sample gathered in Study I. Finally, some recommendations are made.",

      "abstract": "This detailed empirical and doctrinal study of copyright trolling presents new data showing the astonishing rate of growth of multi-defendant John Doe litigation in United States district courts over the past decade. It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases filed.\n\nThis Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the extant literature on copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be counted as part of copyright trolling whenever these suits are motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls are inapt because they do not account for what is now the most widely practiced from of trolling.\n\nIn addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article explores the features of copyright doctrine that have facilitated the recent explosion in trolling litigation in the form of litigation against John Does. In particular, it shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe (MDJD) litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model.",

Once identified, rightly or wrongly, the rational defendant will settle in almost every case because of the overwhelming threat of statutory damages and the difficulty of disproving infringement. \n\n*Statutory damages and the settlements procured in the shadow of statutory damages seem arbitrary and disproportionate to the underlying offense of illegal downloading.\n\n*The technology used to identify suspected infringers raises the specter of surveillance, an increasingly sensitive issue in these post-Snowden times. \n\n*The use of joinder and early discovery to extract account holder information from ISPs while avoiding substantial filing fees looks very much like the exploitation of legal loopholes. \n\n*Even overlooking the sanctionable conduct of some of the more prominent attorneys involved in the pornography cases, the feeling that settlements are procured through something close to extortion is hard to displace.\n\n*Illegal downloading harms copyright owners and reduces their incentives to invest in the production of creative works, but avoiding this harm or being compensated for it has little or nothing to do with the current wave of John Doe litigation that is deluging federal district courts. \n\n*These cases are about monetizing infringement over and above deterrence and compensation. Monetizing infringement is perfectly legal, but unlike the pursuit of deterrence and compensation it is very hard to square with the motivating purpose of copyright law: promoting social progress.\n\n*Reform proposals include: reasonable statutory damages; denying joinder and severing cases; conditional joinder and other safeguards.",

The data substantially undermines any claims of debasement in the most important market for audiobooks.\n\n*There seems little reason to fear that once works fall into the public domain, their value will be substantially reduced based on the amount or manner in which they are used.

      "abstract": "Abstract: In this article we report on the results of an experiment we performed to determine whether transactions in intellectual property (IP) are subject to the valuation anomalies commonly referred to as \u201cendowment effects\u201d. Traditional conceptions of the value of IP rely on assumptions about human rationality derived from classical economics. The law assumes that when people make decisions about buying, selling, and licensing IP they do so with fixed, context-independent preferences. Over the past several decades, this rational actor model of classical economics has come under attack by behavioral data showing that people do not always make strictly rational decisions. Perhaps the most important research in this field is that related to the \u201cendowment effect\u201d \u2013 the discovery that, contrary to economic predictions, people value the same object more when they own it than when they do not. \n\nTo date, the endowment effect has been observed for a variety of goods including mugs, lottery tickets, and hunting permits. Our experiment establishes a substantial valuation asymmetry between authors of poems and potential purchasers of them. As we explain in detail in the article, we constructed a market for the poems that was modeled on a market for licensing IP. The observed differences in valuation indicate that IP licensing markets may be substantially less efficient that previously believed. Our results suggest that (1) the preferences of IP creators, owners, and purchasers are unstable and dependent on the initial distribution of property rights in creative works, and (2) large gaps arise between purchasers\u2019 willingness to pay and sellers\u2019 willingness to accept even though the poems are non-rival property and the contemplated alienation of the property is therefore only partial. \n\nOur findings suggest that private transactions in creative goods may face significant transaction costs arising from cognitive biases that drive the price that creators and owners of IP are likely to demand for transfers considerably higher than what buyers will, on average, be willing to pay. This does not mean, of course, that transactions in IP will not take place \u2013 we see such transactions happening out in the world every day. Our research suggests, however, that IP transactions may occur at a level that is significantly suboptimal, and that the baleful effect of cognitive and affective biases is likely to be more serious for transactions in works of relatively low commercial value, or for which no well-established custom or pattern helps to inform valuation. These results have considerable implications for the structuring of IP rights, IP formalities, IP licensing, and fair use.",

      "abstract": "The Article presents the first empirical study of copyright publication, a concept that can mark a critical moment in the life of a creative work. Books, magazines, films, software and plays, as well as works of art, architecture, music, and even choreography may be protected by copyright. For works created before 1976, knowing whether a work is published is often necessary for determining whether it is in the public domain so that anyone can use it, copy it or adapt it in other media without risking copyright liability. A court\u2019s determination of whether a work is published also may be dispositive of issues such as the duration of the copyright, if others can make fair use of it and whether, in litigation, statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees are available. Despite the obvious import of this concept, it remains one of the most ambiguous features of copyright law. How do judges decide whether a creative work is published? This article presents the first comprehensive and systematic answer to that question. Based on a dataset of federal judicial opinions, this article analyzes the extent to which accepted notions of copyright publication conform with legal doctrine. The results reveal that often they do not. In particular, this article demonstrates that publication has a surprisingly inconsistent meaning across copyright issues, differing dramatically between the public domain and fair use contexts. The analysis shows that the characteristics of the work, as well as how it is distributed and accessed are important to courts when deciding whether a work is in the public domain. These findings are especially noteworthy, since contrary to popular belief, courts increasingly encounter the issue of publication when answering a wide variety of copyright questions. Drawing upon the empirical findings, the Article recommends that the commonly used definitions of publication be changed to reflect the factors upon which judges actually rely in deciding these cases.",

      "abstract": "Apple's success with the Apple iPhone has brought with it certain problems. Its success has revealed a community of hackers that have attempted to circumvent the exclusive arrangement that Apple shares with AT&T for cellular telephone service. Unfortunately for Apple (and similarly situated manufacturers), intellectual property doctrines and laws do not prevent consumers from altering their products so as to circumvent relationships that manufacturers may have with others. Manufacturers inevitably lose capacity to control the product as a result of the sale of specific units. The doctrines of first sale in both patent and copyright law prevent manufacturers from controlling consumer manipulation of the object after the sale has been completed. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention provision does not necessarily apply to prevent consumers from altering firmware within a product. Manufacturers are increasingly turning to alternatives to intellectual property to secure control over the device after the sale. One such alternative is the exclusion of warranty under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for aberrant consumers.\n\nThis article considers whether limitation of warranties may actually have the deterrence effect on consumers that manufacturers desire; said differently, the article weighs whether manufacturers can achieve their goals of preventing consumers from using their products in an unauthorized manner by removing warranty protections from the consumer. The Article presents a behavioral model based on the Triandis' model of planned behavior and enhances the model by accounting for likely and unlikely benefits and detriments. The model suggests that participants weigh the detrimental impact together with the probability and magnitude of the detriment against the beneficial impact together with the probability and magnitude of the benefit when making the decision to engage in technological piracy. Considering only half of the equation - what deterrents are likely to impact consumer behavior - the Article then reconciles the model to empirical evidence suggesting that Apple's warranty could be a stronger deterrent for consumers than civil liability.\n\nThe data collected suggests four observations of the survey pool: (1) known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy; (2) persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy; (3) a better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty's benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability; and (4) the magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved. The article concludes that manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use.",

      "abstract": "In the United States, intellectual property (IP) law is intended to encourage the production of new creative works and inventions. Copyright and patent laws do this by providing qualifying authors and inventors with a bundle of exclusive rights relating to the use and development of their creations. Importantly, however, these fields differ greatly in the ways that they determine whether some new creation is sufficiently innovative to merit legal protection. Copyright law sets the creativity bar especially low for new works of authorship, whereas patent law demands that a putative inventor prove that her creation is highly innovative. Relatively little research has focused on whether the different IP thresholds affect the incentives and behavior of creators.\n\nLegal scholarship on the effects of differing IP thresholds on creators has generally relied on standard economic assumptions about the way that people respond to incentives. Creators are assumed to be rational and to respond to increased incentives by producing more and better creations. According to this reasoning, because patent law requires more creativity as a precondition to the conferral of IP rights compared to what copyright law requires, creators subject to the patent regime will be encouraged to be more creative than those subject to the copyright regime.\n\nRecent research in the social sciences, however, suggests that the connection between incentives and behavior \u2014 particularly with regard to creativity \u2014 is not always so straightforward. Although some research indicates that providing incentives to act creatively has the expected effect of increasing creativity, other research suggests that offering certain types of incentives can undermine creative behavior. For example, monetary incentives to perform creative tasks may dampen creativity. Moreover, and importantly for our purposes, increasing the magnitude of an incentive to be creative may not always lead to more or better behavior. Once creativity incentives are sufficiently salient or intense, there is a risk that people will be overly focused on achieving the incentive and \u201cchoke.\u201d\n\nIn the series of experiments reported in this Article, we extend the research on the effects of incentives for creativity into the realm of intellectual property. Specifically, we test whether the existence of a creativity threshold that conditions entry into a prize lottery on meeting certain performance standards affects how creative people are. The experiments reported here involve various creativity tasks in which subjects are randomly assigned to conditions that are intended to model the different creativity thresholds employed by copyright and patent law. Doing so allows us to test whether the existence and nature of a threshold increases, decreases, or does not affect subjects\u2019 creativity.\n\nThis research contributes to the growing debates about whether copyright law\u2019s creativity threshold is set too low and should be increased and whether patent law\u2019s creativity threshold is appropriately set. More broadly, this research adds to the growing literature in law, psychology, economics, and management on the effects of incentives on behavior.",

      "abstract": "Despite considerable research suggesting that creators value attribution \u2013 i.e., being named as the creator of a work \u2013 U.S. intellectual property (IP) law does not provide a right to attribution to the vast majority of creators. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are a lot more complicated than that. \n\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to quantitatively measure the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a \u201ccreativity effect\u201d that results in them assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced \u2013 creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be re-structured to provide attribution as a creator\u2019s default right. \n\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, and paradoxically, our findings also suggest that before we restructure American law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators, we need to take care, because it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting. \n\nFinally, our findings have important implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently-structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.",

      "abstract": "This article shows the phases \u2013 and discusses the results \u2013 of an empirical analysis addressing the legal business models that are adopted online to distribute digital content. Although it premised upon the idea that these models would have been greatly affected by the strong protection that digital copyright law offers to rightholders, it concluded the opposite way. The \u2018all rights reserved model\u2019 that is tenaciously incentivized by the current legislative framework is, indeed, all but dominant: it is overcome by \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018interactive\u2019 models that take full advantage from the architecture of the online environment and from flexible forms of copyright licensing. More in general, the results of the empirical analysis show that the current legal framework does not considerably affect the models of distribution that are implemented in practice; rather, they are significantly influenced by many other factors, such as the technology used for making digital content available.\nTherefore, the article acknowledges how the current legal framework is inadequate and inconsistent with the business tools that entrepreneurs are employing and testing to better satisfy the demand. In order to show how the market diverges from the on line distribution model of digital content envisaged at legislative level, in the first section we give an account of the digital age turmoil and expectations, so to show how evidence about on line distribution of digital content is needed. This need is further confirmed by the literature review about distribution models for digital content that we after carried out in section 2. In sections 3 and 4 we describe the methodology followed and present the initial results obtained, which will be further analyzed in section 5 via a cluster analysis. In section 6 we comment and discuss those last so to illustrate, in section 7, our conclusions. We affirm that while the current legal framework, though biased towards a pre-determined solution for online distribution of digital content, has not inhibited the development of a kaleidoscopic market for online distribution, an enabling legal framework could foster it further and, by doing this, could favour the match between the demand and the supply of digital content.",

      "abstract": "Firms in the copyright-intensive industries frequently complain that copyright infringement causes significant lost sales, lost revenues, lost profits, and lost jobs. However, as has been noted in numerous impartial studies, the actual impact of infringement on individual firms, on industry sectors, and on the U.S. economy as a whole, is extremely difficult to quantify. In contrast, what can be quantified with relative ease is the performance of firms in the copyright-intensive industries in terms that matter to investors: revenue, profit, and most importantly, profitability. Furthermore, the performance of firms in the copyright-intensive industries can readily be compared with the performance of firms in other industries. While such a comparison may not demonstrate the effect of infringement, it could provide guidance to policymakers as to whether the copyright-intensive industries require additional government assistance in the form of new legislation or law enforcement resources. In this study, the authors have examined the performance over the past ten years of five leading firms in three copyright-intensive industries: motion pictures, publishing, and software. They then examined the performance of five leading firms in three other industries: construction, transportation, and mining. Finally, they compared the profitability of the firms in these six industries. We found that the firms in the copyright-intensive industries were more profitable than the firms in the other industries in every period examined.",

      "abstract": "Since 2002 the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has supported research on assessing the economic contribution of industries which are dependent on copyright and related rights protection \u2013 \u201cthe copyright industries\u201d (CRI) . In 2003 WIPO published common guidelines on carrying out such research throughout the world (WIPO 2003, 2012a, 2012b). \n\nThis paper presents a critique of a number of recent studies which have departed from the widely accepted WIPO approach outlined above and instead attempted to estimate the economic effects of what they call copyright exceptions industries (CEI) that rely on exceptions to copyright law. These studies in effect attempt to challenge the approach of the WIPO and assert that exceptions to copyright law might make a larger economic contribution than copyright law itself. \n\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) CCIA issued the first of these \u201ccopyright exceptions\u201d or \u201cfair use\u201d studies in 2007, under taken by Capital Trade Inc (CT) which purported to measure CEI in the US during the period 2002-2006. CCIA has since commissioned CT to update this study in the US twice, first in 2010 , and then in 2011. In 2010 the CCIA further commissioned a study of the European Union (EU) this time by SEO Economic Research which adapted and applied the same approach used by CT in the US. Recently in September 2012 the Australian Digital Alliance (ADA) similarly commissioned and released two reports written by Lateral Economics (LE) that adapted and applied the methodology used in the US and EU to Australia.\n\nWe focus our critique in this paper primarily on the LE Australian study as it is the most recent attempt to measure copyright exceptions by applying the methodology developed in the US. Our critique of the LE approach however can be readily generalised to the older US and EU studies.\n\nThe main conclusions of the LE study of Australia we shall focus on then are that:\n\n*\u201cflexible copyright \u2018exceptions\u2019 and better crafted \u2018safe harbours\u2019 would make a substantial contribution to Australia\u2019s economic growth and innovation with negligible downsides for rights holders; and\n\n*the recommended changes would improve productivity growth. Over time the additional value added to the Australian economy is conservatively estimated to grow to around $600 million annually. \n\nThis paper identifies three fundamental flaws in the LE\u2019s papers analysis that make the analysis unreliable and its recommendations irrelevant. \n\n*The first is fundamental weaknesses in the theoretical economic analysis of the costs and benefits of broadening copyright exemptions;\n\n*The second is fundamental weaknesses in the empirical analysis and in particular the methodology it adopts from earlier US and European Studies;\n\n*The third is fundamental weaknesses in the legal analysis.\n\nContrary to the LE reports this paper suggests that any weakening in the enforcement of copyright, through introduction of ill defined exceptions and safe harbours of the kind promoted in the LE reports, would have significant negative economic costs, and little or no benefit. \n\nEconomic theory further suggests that if there are flexible copyright \u2018exceptions\u2019 and better crafted \u2018safe harbours\u2019 that would make a substantial contribution to Australia\u2019s economic growth and innovation, with negligible downsides for rights holders, then in all likelihood they would have already been agreed to in the market or may be expected to emerge over time through automated market based electronic payment systems.",

      "abstract": "An interesting yet less explored aspect of the eBay decision, in which the Supreme Court upheld the four-factor test under traditional principles of equity in the patent injunction context, is that the decision referred to what it characterized as long-term practice in copyright law to support the equitable power of lower courts to deny permanent injunctions. This ruling was made against the backdrop of widespread patent holdup where patent owners used the threat of injunctive relief to extract royalties grossly disproportionate to the value of the patented feature to the whole product. The holdup problem, however, is not equally obvious in copyright law. \n\nA close examination of the copyright cases cited in eBay reveals that they are hardly compelling authorities with respect to copyright injunction. The history of copyright law appears to suggest that injunctive relief was routinely available to copyright owners who had succeeded on the merits. More remarkably, empirical evidence shows that the majority of post-eBay decisions on copyright injunctions have totally ignored the eBay decision as well as the four-factor test advocated therein. Even among the cases that did cite eBay, most courts were reluctant to withhold injunctive relief upon a finding of copyright infringement. \n\nThis Article argues that the traditional practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of judges. Copyright holdup is much less pervasive than patent holdup, as interchangeable copyrighted works abound in the marketplace, and copyright law contains built-in mechanisms to control the holdup problem. Copyright injunctions also involve a distinct set of policy concerns, such as reputational harm, fair use, statutory damages, and freedom of speech. Hence, this Article proposes several approaches to reconcile the unique concerns in copyright law and the four-factor test mandated by eBay, with a focus on three scenarios that are particularly susceptible to the holdup problem.",

      "abstract": "Copyright has an innovation problem. Judicial decisions, private enforcement, and public dialogue ignore innovation and overemphasize the harms of copyright infringement. Just to pick one example, \u201cpiracy,\u201d \u201ctheft,\u201d and \u201crogue websites\u201d were the focus of debate in connection with the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). But such a debate ignores the effect of copyright law and enforcement on innovation. Even though innovation is the most important factor in economic growth, it is difficult to observe, especially in comparison to copyright infringement.\n\nThis article addresses this problem. It presents the results of a groundbreaking study of 31 CEOs, company founders, and vice-presidents from technology companies, the recording industry, and venture capital firms. Based on in-depth interviews, the article offers original insights on the relationship between copyright law and innovation. It also analyzes the behavior of the record labels when confronted with the digital music revolution. And it traces innovators\u2019 and investors\u2019 reactions to the district court\u2019s injunction in the case involving peer-to-peer (p2p) service Napster.\n\nThe Napster ruling presents an ideal setting for a natural experiment. As the first decision to enjoin a p2p service, it presents a crucial data point from which we can trace effects on innovation and investment. This article concludes that the Napster decision reduced innovation and that it led to a venture capital \u201cwasteland.\u201d The article also explains why the record labels reacted so sluggishly to the distribution of digital music. It points to retailers, lawyers, bonuses, and (consistent with the \u201cInnovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d) an emphasis on the short term and preservation of existing business models.\nThe article also steps back to look at copyright litigation more generally. It demonstrates the debilitating effects of lawsuits and statutory damages. It gives numerous examples, in the innovators\u2019 own words, of the effects of personal liability. It traces the possibilities of what we have lost from the Napster decision and from copyright litigation generally. And it points to losses to innovation, venture capital, markets, licensing, and the \u201cmagic\u201d of music.\nThe story of innovation in digital music is a fascinating one that has been ignored for too long. This article aims to fill this gap, ensuring that innovation plays a role in today\u2019s copyright debates.",

We study the biographical Wikipedia pages of a large data set of authors, composers, and lyricists to determine whether the public domain status of available images leads to a higher rate of inclusion of illustrated supplementary material and whether such inclusion increases visitorship to individual pages. We attempt to objectively place a value on the body of public domain photographs and illustrations which are used in this global resource. We find that the most historically remote subjects are more likely to have images on their web pages because their biographical life-spans pre-date the existence of in-copyright imagery. We find that the large majority of photos and illustrations used on subject pages were obtained from the public domain, and we estimate their value in terms of costs saved to Wikipedia page builders and in terms of increased traffic corresponding to the inclusion of an image. Then, extrapolating from the characteristics of a random sample of a further 300 Wikipedia pages, we estimate a total value of public domain photographs on Wikipedia of between $246 to $270 million dollars per year.",

More specifically, to the extent that the rate of copyright litigation has increased over the last two decades, that increase appears to be entirely attributable to lawsuits against anonymous Internet file sharers. These lawsuits largely took place in two distinct phases: the first phase largely consisted of lawsuits seeking to discourage illegal downloading; the second phase largely consists lawsuits seeking to monetize online infringement. \n* Second, in relation to patent litigation, the apparent patent litigation explosion between 2010 and 2012 is something of a mirage; however there has been a sustained patent litigation inflation over the last two decades the extent of which has not been fully recognized until now. The reason why this steady inflation was mistaken for a sudden explosion was that the true extent of patent litigation was disguised by permissive joinder.\n* Third, in relation to the geography of IP litigation, it appears that filings in copyright, patent and trademark litigation are generally highly correlated. The major exceptions to that correlation are driven by short term idiosyncratic events in copyright and trademark litigation \u2014 these are discussed in detail \u2014 and by the dumbfounding willingness of the Eastern district Texas to engage in forum selling to attract patent litigation. The popularity of the Eastern District of Texas as a forum for patent litigation is a well-known phenomenon.

      "abstract": "We present the results of a series of surveys of college-aged consumers of music exploring their willingness to pay for digital downloads of music and measuring the impact of the so-called analog hole. The analog hole refers to a perhaps - unavoidable vulnerability of most digital rights management systems. In short, because people cannot consume digital information directly, every device that performs digital content must convert the digital information into an analog signal, which is very difficult to keep from being copied.\nAlthough the analog hole has been widely decried by content providers, surprisingly little is known about fundamental aspects of how it operates. Can average users exploit the analog hole, or is this limited to sophisticated users? Does analog hole copying significantly degrade the quality of music or video? Will people pay for music that isn't a perfect digital copy? Intuitions and guesses abound, but nobody has ever conducted a study to answer these questions. We have. Although our surveys' sample sizes were too small to come to statistically significant conclusions, we did discover several interesting results including one tantalizingly specific result: What's the analog hole worth? Based on our survey, twenty-four cents. That's how much less our respondents were willing to pay for a music track when a perfect digital copy was replaced by an analog hole copy. Although our results need to be replicated on a larger scale, they suggest many conclusions that have never before been proved: people are willing to pay for less-than-perfect analog hole copies of songs; people will pay much more than half the price of a typically-priced digital music file for its degraded alternative; and even self-avowed \"pirates\" show a willingness to pay for digital music, albeit at prices well below today's market standard of ninety-nine cents a song.",

      "abstract": "The effective management of digital rights is the central challenge in many industries making the transition from physical to digital products. We present a new model that characterizes the value of these digital rights when products are sold both embedded in tangible physical artifacts, and as pure digital goods, and when granting rights permitted by one's digital rights management (DRM) platform may affect the extent of digital piracy. Our model indicates that in the absence of piracy, digital rights should be unrestricted, since a seller can use its pricing strategy to optimally balance sales between physical and digital goods. However, the threat of piracy limits the extent to which digital rights should be granted: the value of digital rights is determined not only by their direct effect on the quality of legal digital goods, but by a differential piracy effect that can lower a seller's pricing power. When the latter effect is sufficiently high, granting digital rights can have a detrimental effect on value - our model indicates that this kind of effect is more likely to be observed for digital rights that aim to replicate the consumption experience of physical goods, rather than enhancing a customer's digital experience. We test the predictions of our analytical model using data from the ebook industry. Our empirical evidence supports our theoretical results, showing that four separate digital rights each have an economically significant impact on ebook prices, and establishing that the digital rights which aim to replicate physical consumption while increasing the threat of piracy are the ones that have negative impact on seller value.\nWe also show that if the pricing of a digital good is keyed off that of an existing tangible good, optimal pricing changes for the former should be more nuanced, rather than simply mirroring changes in the price of the latter, and we discuss the effect of the technological sophistication of potential customers on optimal pricing and rights management. Our results represent new evidence of the importance of an informed and judicious choice of the different digital rights granted by a DRM platform, and provide a new framework for guiding managers in industries that are progressively being digitized.",

      "abstract": "The Attorney-General\u2019s Department has carried out a review of the operation of two copyright exceptions that permit \u2018format-shifting\u2019. These exceptions are sections 47J and 110AA of the Copyright Act 1968 which permit photographs and cinematograph films to be reproduced in a different format for private use, subject to certain conditions.  The review included a call for interested party submissions and intergovernmental agency consultations.\nCopyright is a form of intellectual property that protects the rights of creators in certain original forms of expression, including photographs and cinematograph films. It rewards creative effort, and economic investment in creative effort, by granting a number of exclusive economic rights. These rights provide an incentive to encourage the generation and flow of new material to the public. One of the core rights granted by copyright is the right to prevent other persons from copying a work. While copyright does not guarantee a proportionate return for the work involved, the ability to require other persons to pay for copying can give creators and investors some security for the skill, time and resources necessary to produce new works.\nThe Act also provides many exceptions which limit the scope of copyright. These exceptions are an integral part of copyright, recognising that in some circumstances the usual rights of copyright owners should not apply. Exceptions may be adopted for various reasons; such as to permit incidental uses that do not cause significant harm to copyright owners or because a particular limitation of copyright serves the broader public interest. The nature and scope of exceptions reflect decisions by Parliament on balancing public and private interests.",

      "abstract": "Contracts lie at the heart of the regulatory system governing the creation and dissemination of cultural products in two respects: (1) The exclusive rights provided by copyright law only turn into financial reward, and thus incentives to creators, through a contract with a third party to exploit protected material. (2) From a user perspective purchases of protected material may take the form of a licensing contract, governing behaviour after the initial transaction.\nThus, a review of the relationship between copyright and contract law has to address both supply- and demand-side issues. On the supply side, policy concerns include whether copyright law delivers the often stated aim of securing the financial independence of creators. Particularly acute are the complaints by both creators and producers that they fail to benefit from the exponential increase in the availability of copyright materials on the Internet. On the demand side, the issue of copyright exceptions and their policy justification has become central to a number of reviews and consultations dealing with digital content. Are exceptions based on user needs or market failure? Do exceptions require financial compensation? Can exceptions be contracted out by licence agreements?\nThis report (i) reviews economic theory of contracts, value chains and transaction costs, (ii) identifies a comprehensive range of regulatory options relating to creator and user contracts, using an international comparative approach, (iii) surveys the empirical evidence on the effects of regulatory intervention, and (iv) where no evidence is available, extrapolates predicted effects from theory.",

As Thomas Babington (Lord) Macaulay argued in a famous speech on copyright reform in the House of Commons (5 February 1841): \u201c\u2026there are only two ways in which (men of letters) can be remunerated. One of those is patronage; the other is copyright.\u201d\nIn a continuous line of reasoning, the thought persisted into the recitals of current European legislation. The 2001 Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC) is introduced thus: \u201cIf authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive appropriate reward for the use of their work\u2026\u201d (Recital 10). \u201cA rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers\u201d (Recital 11).\nThis study shows quite conclusively that current copyright law has empirically failed to meet these aims. The rewards to best-selling writers are indeed high but as a profession, writing has remained resolutely unprosperous.",

      "abstract": "In Australia, the Copyright Act 1968 gives exclusive (but limited) rights to copyright owners as to how their material may be used. These rights include the right to copy, adapt, publish, communicate to the public and publicly perform the copyright material.  To balance the rights of copyright owners with the needs of the general public, the Copyright Act provides a number of exceptions to the general rules regarding infringement of copyright. The appropriate role and scope of these exceptions has been an ongoing matter for debate, particularly with the advent of digital copying (see ALRC 2013).\n\nConsistent with an emerging interest in better understanding the size and economic contribution of those industries which rely, to varying degrees, on copyright law, this study uses the global framework (WIPO 2003) to document the economic contribution of Australia\u2019s copyright industries over time. Due to data classification variations, the results presented in this report differ somewhat from previous estimates.\n\nThis is the fourth copyright industries economic contribution study supported by the Australian Copyright Council (see Allen Consulting Group 2001, PwC 2008, PwC 2012).  It is important to appreciate that while the focus of this report is on the economic activity reliant to some degree on the institutional support provided by copyright law, there are a range of cultural, social and other benefits associated with the creation of copyright protected material that are not necessarily captured in the reported figures. That is, elements of copyright material - such as arts, which are seen as an important part of Australian lives - may generate benefits (e.g. cultural) that are not necessarily reflected in the market value for the goods or services (Towse 2000, p 115) ;(Australia Council 2014, p 10).\n\nIn compiling this report it is difficult to not consider the forces that have emerged to shape Australia\u2019s copyright industries in recent years:\n#Over the period considered in this study the demand for Australia\u2019s natural resources, principally to support the rapid growth of China, has meant that the Australian Dollar has been above its historic average value. As a consequence, imports have become cheaper, to the point that we have seen deflation across a range of imported products, and a continued decline in Australia\u2019s copyright industry manufacturing base.\n#Many copyright products (e.g. music, movies, games, software, books, newspapers, etc) are continuing to move from physical distribution to electronic distribution, enabling the disintermediation of the supply chain (e.g. lessening the need for a physical retail presence) as consumers have shifted their consumption to digital versions and online delivery\n#There has been an increased risk of unauthorised copying because of the low cost of reproduction of perfect digital copies. Indeed the value of the production of unauthorised copyright products is not included even though they should possibly be considered part of the copyright industries.\n\nIn this changing and challenging environment there is a continued need for copyright industries to develop, supported by copyright law, which provides certainty and the incentive to innovate and grow.",

The total gross value\nadded, which measures wealth added to the economy, represented more than 5.3 % of\nthe total value added for the 15 EU Member States. In terms of employment, the\nindustries contributed 3.1 % of total EU employment. As a result of gaps in data that\nare normally experienced when using national accounts and employment data from\nofficial international and statistical sources, a complete set of data was unavailable for\nstudy. These problems that arise as a result of these gaps in data are addressed in the\nstudy. The authors estimate that the effect of gaps in data understates the real\ncontribution of copyright to the European economy by 5 to 10 %.\nThe copyright industries are divided into 2 parts: 1) core copyright industries that are\nbased upon the creation, distribution, and sale of copyright products and services (for\nexample, magazines, motion pictures, recorded music, software), and 2) copyrightdependent\nindustries that would not exist without the existence of products and\nservices subject to copyright (for example, television set manufacturers, DVD player\nmanufacturers, computer manufacturers). Together they combine to form an overall\ncopyright industry that is among the most important contributor to the European\neconomy.\n\nThis assessment of the contribution of copyright industries to the European economy\nfocuses on the turnover, value added, and employment provided by the industries.\nTurnover provides a measure of the flow of cash into the industries before costs, value\nadded shows what wealth the industries create for the economy, and employment\nindicates the extent to which individuals and society benefit through jobs creation.\nThe core and dependent copyright industries both make significant contributions but\nthe core industries are the most important to the European economy (Figure 1).",

      "abstract": "Copyright law\u2019s requirement of substantial similarity requires a court to satisfy itself that a defendant\u2019s copying, even when shown to exist as a factual matter, is quantitatively and qualitatively enough to render it actionable as infringement. By the time a jury reaches the question of substantial similarity, however, the court has usually heard and analyzed a good deal of evidence: about the plaintiff, the defendant, the creativity involved, the process through which the work was created, the reasons for which the work was produced, the defendant\u2019s own creative efforts and behavior, and on occasion the market effects of the defendant\u2019s copying. Despite having this large body of evidence before it, the jury is required to answer the question of substantial similarity through a mere comparison of the two works. In this Essay, we report results from a series of experiments in which subjects were presented with a pair of images and asked to assess the similarity between the two works using the criteria ordinarily given to fact-finders for the substantial similarity determination. When provided with additional information about the simple fact of copying, or about the amount of creative effort that went into the protected work, we saw an appreciable variation (i.e., upwards) in subjects\u2019 assessments of similarity between the works, suggesting that fact-finders are sensitive to additional information about the two works and the creators who produced them, contrary to what current law assumes. Our study suggests that the availability and salience of such additional information actively distorts fact-finders' assessments of the similarity between the two works, calling into question the purported objectivity of the substantial similarity requirement as a whole.",

      "abstract": "Authorship, and hence, initial ownership of copyrighted works is oftentimes controlled by the 1976 Copyright Act\u2019s work made for hire doctrine. This doctrine states that works created by employees within the scope of their employment result in the employer owning the copyright. One key determination in this analysis is whether the hired party is an employee or independent contractor. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court, in CCNV v. Reid, answered the question of how employees are distinguished from independent contractors by setting forth a list of factors courts should consider. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not give further guidance on how to balance these factors. Three years later, in 1992, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided Aymes v. Bonelli and noted that not all factors are equally weighted and that five of the factors would \u201cbe significant in virtually every situation.\u201d This analysis was supported by looking at all the work made for hire cases decided in the three year period since Reid \u2013 six cases in total. This Article expands in both scope and time what the Second Circuit did in Aymes and systematically analyzes how courts have utilized the factors in the twenty-five years since Reid. In particular, this study has identified the universe of cases where the courts have decided whether a hired party was an employee or independent contractor and uses the data from these cases to describe what factors appear to be the most and least important in reaching these conclusions. Based on the results of this study, this Article proposes a continuum of importance, which graphically illustrates the relative importance of each factor.",

It starts by elaborating on the reasons for intellectual property protection, by reporting a few facts about copyright protection, and by examining reasons to become a digital pirate. Next, it provides an exploration of the consequences of digital piracy, using a base model and several extensions (with consumer sampling, network effects, and indirect appropriation). A closer look at market-structure implications of end-user piracy is then taken. After a brief review of commercial piracy, additional legal and private responses to end-user piracy are considered. Finally, a quick look at emerging new business models is taken.",

This literature, which started in the mid-1980s, really mushroomed at the turn of the 21st century when digital piracy became a topic of intense debate.\n\n* Initially, in terms of welfare, it was considered that piracy was likely to improve welfare in the short run (as the deadweight loss of monopoly is reduced) but to deteriorate it in the long run (as lower profits imply lower incentives to create and to improve products). These conclusions were established in a number of seminal papers considering a simple monopoly framework.\n\n* Subsequent analyses extended this basic approach in several directions. First, it was suggested that piracy also had the potential to increase the right-holders\u2019 profits. A second line of extension was to examine the effects of piracy in environments where several digital products compete with one another.

      "abstract": "Open source software, developed by volunteers, appears counter to the conventional wisdom that private provision of public goods is socially more efficient. But complexity makes a difference. Under standard models, development contracts for specialized software may be difficult to write and ownership rights do not necessarily elicit socially optimal effort. I consider three mechanisms that improve the likelihood that firms can obtain the software they need: pre-packaged software, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Free/Open Source software (FOSS). I show that with complex software, some firms will choose to participate in FOSS over both \"make or buy\" and this increases social welfare. In general, FOSS complements proprietary provision, rather than replacing it. Pre-packaged software can coexist in the marketplace with FOSS: pre-packaged software addresses common uses with limited feature sets, while firms with specialized, more complex needs use FOSS.",

Using a data set of over 8,500 price observations collected over a period of 15 months, we compare pricing behavior at 41 Internet and conventional retail outlets.\nWe find that prices on the Internet are 9\u201316% lower than prices in conventional outlets,\ndepending on whether taxes, shipping, and shopping costs are included in the price.\nAdditionally, we find that Internet retailers\u2019 price adjustments over time are up to 100 times smaller than conventional retailers\u2019 price adjustments\u2014presumably reflecting lower menu costs in Internet channels. We also find that levels of price dispersion depend importantly on the measures employed. When we compare the prices posted by different Internet retailers we find substantial dispersion. Internet retailer prices differ by an average of 33% for books and 25% for CDs. However, when we weight these prices by proxies for market share, we find dispersion is lower in Internet channels than in conventional channels, reflecting the dominance of certain heavily branded retailers.\nWe conclude that while there is lower friction in many dimensions of Internet competition,\nbranding, awareness, and trust remain important sources of heterogeneity among Internet\nretailers.",

This is especially true in creative spaces where rules about reuse and remix are notoriously gray. Based on a content analysis of public forum postings in eight different online communities featuring different media types (music, video, art, and writing), we found that copyright is a frequent topic of conversation and that much of this discourse stems from problems that copyright causes for creative activities. We identify the major types of problems encountered, including chilling effects that negatively impact technology use. We find that many challenges can be explained by lack of knowledge about legal or policy rules, including breakdowns in user expectations for the sites they use. We argue that lack of clarity is a pervasive usability problem that should be considered more carefully in the design of user-generated content platforms.",

      "proposition": "*The exclusive rights laid down in the Directive have indeed contributed to increased confidence in emerging digital markets and online business models. This conclusion however was to be mitigated by the fact that many of these rights already existed prior to the Directive, albeit not in a harmonized European framework. \n*The right of making available has undoubtedly resulted in a large-scale redrafting of contracts to adapt to online markets. However, applying the terms of the Directive does not always lead to clear-cut results. To cite one example, it remains unclear and entails practical problems whether streaming is to fall under the right of making available or if it is to be counted under broadcasting rights.\n*The codification of a broad right of reproduction that includes temporary copying is widely perceived as having created obstacles to budding online business models. This stems from the fact that it has created an overlap with the right of communication to the public, which adds complexity to the licensing process and sometimes a need for \u2018double\u2019 licenses from concurrent rightholders or collecting societies. Indeed, it could be said that this aspect of the Directive has raised transaction costs. It was therefore suggested to further restrict the right of reproduction to the realm of physical copies.\n*The need to simplify cross-border licensing which is still tributary to national laws was also broached. One way to deal with this was to promote Community-wide licensing, as was being attempted by the Commission\u2019s Recommendation. Another, more fundamental approach would be to truly unify copyright norms by establishing a unified European copyright regime.\n*A clear need for a higher degree of harmonisation was certainly felt in the area of limitations. Most participants seemed to favour the introduction of a list of mandatory exceptions, possibly including certain non-overridable limitations. However, because many such exceptions are informed by cultural considerations, not everyone agreed such a mandatory list is desirable. Those who favoured a rapprochement with the American \u2018fair use\u2019 concept were countered with the argument that its flexibility could undermine legal certainty. It was agreed that consumer interests which are also reflected in certain exceptions to copyright should be dealt with primarily in the framework of consumer law.\n*The application of TPMs, in turn, has likely fostered the emergence of online business models as investment in online subscription services has apparently increased. However, many doubt the necessity of adding an additional legal layer of protection through anti-circumvention rules.",

In this article, we trace the origins of this provision to a conceptual shift that took place during the early 1800s. Specific regulations of the book trade were superseded by the protection of all instantiations (such as performances, translations and adaptations) of abstract authored work. For two seminal copyright acts of the period, the Prussian Act of 1837 and the UK Act of 1842, we show there was considerable concern about the economic implications of this new justificatory paradigm, reflected in a period of experimentation with sophisticated registration requirements. We indicate market responses to these requirements and plea for a reconsideration of \u201cformalities\u201d as redressing justificatory problems of copyright in the digital environment.",

It involved a decision over which works warranted protection (creating some opportunity costs) and modest fees to the registrar.30 In imposing opportunity and administration costs, registration increases the public domain to all works which creators or publishers do not consider valuable enough to offset these costs. Broadly speaking, any registration requirement reduces the number of works in copyright - by how much depends on the precise structure of the system. From the patent system, we may glean that there are at least two further ways of increasing the public domain effects of registration: increasing annual fees, and claims that specify the precise nature of the rights granted.\nFrom a public policy perspective, this trade off is welcome. Protection is only granted to exploitations that are commercially valuable (and might not have occurred without protection), while future authors can make free and creative use of a larger number of cultural materials. This tallies with a widely accepted economic and political premise that access to information is central to innovation and the fabric of open societies.",

Pace Berne, these registration mechanisms should be subjected to a more far-reaching welfare analysis. Digital technology may not only facilitate copying, but also allow the creation and maintenance of databases defining modes of exploitation and rights claimed. Some of the energies of the entertainment industry\u2019s anti-piracy campaign may be fruitfully channelled into such an enterprise. \nIt may not be realistic to expect an imminent review of the international copyright regime following the integration of key parts of Berne into the TRIPS agreement of 1994 (now administered by the WTO). However, copyright enforcement in the digital environment depends on a certain level of normative consensus among its users.

The concept of  an \"industry system\" is proposed as a useful frame of reference in which to trace the filtering of new products and ideas as they flow from producer to consumer, and in which to examine relations among organizations.

This causes resources such as promotional materials to be distributed unevenly with emphasis on only a few items. There is thus an expectation that many new cultural items will fail.\n# Cooptation of mass media gatekeepers: An example of this would be a record company advertising in the trade press or encouraging a gatekeeper, which could be a popular radio station, to cover their new artist. This however conflicts with the interest of the gatekeeper, because if done too much it could affect the reputation of the gatekeeper negatively.  \nThe authors conclude by introducing the concept of \u201cindustrial systems\u201d as a frame of reference to trace the flow of  new products/ideas as they are filtered at each level or organisation and to examine  relationships among organisations.",

The second provided a separate look-up of all other recorded offences relating to the unique case identifiers associated with the CDPA 1988 records.\n\nThe first set of Ministry of Justice data identified 2,808 people convicted of a copyright offence over the period. Of these 2,808 people, 2,100 were convicted of Summary offences and 708 were indictable offences.\n\nData relating to prosecutions was also provided by the Crown Prosecution Service, Trading Standards and the IP Crime Report. \n\nA short survey was devised to understand the experiences of individual copyright owners in dealing with online infringement. While the respondent numbers were modest (n=40), they came from a number of different constituencies within the creative industries (illustrators, artists, graphic designers, musicians, photographers, games companies, software engineers and others who place their digital materials online).",

The online criminal provisions of CDPA 1988 are hardly being used, if at all. There has been a lack of clarity over how they can be applied, and even if this is addressed, they will not provide access to appropriate and proportionate sentences for serious infringement cases. If no change is made, this problem will continue.\n\nii. There is a case for increasing sanctions relating to online offences, especially if the civil case law is believed to have developed to a point where prosecutions can now be brought successfully against criminal activity. However, safeguards may be needed to ensure that ordinary members of the public and those whose copying is not motivated by a criminal intent are not inadvertently caught by any amended provision. Also, there must be a proportionate approach that permits legitimate experimentation.\n\niii. Custodial sentences in excess of two years have been used for physical copying offences. While no evidence was found of sanctions exceeding five years, the available data does not provide a basis for concluding that the level of physical penalties is inappropriate \u2013 it is rare to have the maximum sentence applied to any such crime, but important to have the means to establish a scale of offending.\n\niv. There is logic to placing serious online copyright offences into a more serious category, which soundings taken for this study equate with a maximum sentence of at least five years. The precedents within the IP landscape are either to leave offences outside the criminal justice system altogether (as in the case of patents) or to set a maximum offence on conviction at ten years. Fundamentally, either online copyright offences are capable of causing serious harm, or they are not.\"",

      "proposition": "Music\n\n* No evidence in support of a widely-held view that stores are including in their price the permission to copy. All digital albums are allowed to be copied for personal use, as opposed to CD albums that cannot be copied. \n\n* In spite of this, digital music is associated with a lower price compared to a CD. Whether the lower price depends on the store, on the intangible nature of the product, or on the possibility to copy, cannot be determined due to the lack of variability in the explanatory variables. \n\n* As private copying for personal use is widespread and allowed in the UK, it is plausible that private copying is already largely or fully priced in the UK market. Consumers and producers of music appear to expect that music will be copied for personal non-commercial use and all downloads are sold on these terms.\n\nFilm\n\n* In parallel with traditional films, which come with only one license (e.g. Blu-Ray and DVD), the film industry has found different ways to allow users to have more than one copy of the films they purchase. Examples can be found in the sales of digital films (which could be copied onto a number devices), by bundling multiple formats in the same package (which may also include a complimentary downloadable digital copy), or through new kinds of licenses, such as Ultraviolet. \n\n* The study found a positive relationship between price and film copies. In particular, since different types of formats have different impacts on price, we can conclude that film stores charge users not simply to have more copies, but to have the opportunity to choose from a higher variety of available choices.\n\nBooks\n\n* All the bookstores in the sample allow users to make copies of their eBooks. In particular, the copying terms and conditions are enforced using technologies embedded in the eBooks (DRMs) which are able to limit the number of copies that users is allowed and the kinds of devices in which the eBooks may be read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, eBook readers). \n\n* The influence of the number of copies allowed and the number of allowable devices on the price could not be determined because (1) of the lack of variability in the explanatory variables, and (2) to the fact that the large majority of price dissimilarities were captured by the difference between traditional books and eBooks. \n\n* However, when considering that they are allowed to be copied, eBooks are on average less expensive than physical books (which are not allowed to be copied). This premium for a physical book is of course likely to be explained by manufacturing costs and the value consumers place on physical features, rather than on the number of copies that can be made from it.\n\nSoftware\n\n* This market case was used partly as a control case as it would notionally not be affected by a private copying exception. However, it is a  sector, which actively tries to price for additional copies. \n\n* The analysis suggests that software producers charge a price that reflects the possibility of making additional copies. In other words, a higher number of copies is associated with an increase in the price. However, this effect becomes smaller as the number of copies increases.",

      "proposition": "IPR-intensive industries are defined as those having an above-average use of IPR per employee.\nThe present study shows that about half of European industries can be considered IPR\u2011intensive.\nIt should be emphasised, however, that all industries use IP rights to some extent. By focusing only on the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\n\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries.6 On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by IPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR\u2011dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\n\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth \u20ac 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU\u2019s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus. IPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage premium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.\n\nIn addition to their direct employment contribution, IPR-intensive industries also generate employment in other, non\u2011IPR-intensive industries which supply them with goods and services as inputs to their production processes. Using the EU27 Input Output Tables, published by Eurostat, it is possible to calculate this indirect effect on employment in non\u2011IPR\u2011intensive industries. The result is summarised in table 2, which shows a breakdown by direct and indirect employment. Including the indirect jobs in the calculation implies that 35.1% of EU jobs are contributed by the IPR-intensive industries, directly and indirectly.\n\nBesides employment, IPR-intensive industries contribute to economic output, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Overall, almost 39% of EU GDP is generated in IPR-intensive industries, with trade mark-intensive industries accounting for 34%, design-intensive industries for 13%, patent-intensive industries for 14% and copyright and GI-intensive industries for smaller proportions. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed breakdown of these industries\u2019 contributions to the national economies of the EU Member States.\n\nComparing the results of this EU study with those for the US reveals that the two economies have a similar structure, as is to be expected given their similar level of development. However, in terms of the contribution of IPR-intensive industries, the shares in employment and GDP are somewhat higher in the EU: 26% vs. 19% for employment and 39% vs. 35% for GDP. However, in both studies, trade mark-intensive industries account for the highest shares in both employment and GDP, followed by patents and copyright in the US and by designs, patents and copyright in the EU. Similarly, the wage premiums in IPR-intensive industries compared to other industries are similar: 41% in the EU and 42% in the US, with copyright-intensive and patent intensive industries having the highest premiums on both sides of the Atlantic.\nGiven that 39% of GDP (value added) in the economy and 26% of employment is generated in IPRintensive industries, the value added per employee is higher in IPR-intensive industries than in the rest of the economy. Economic theory suggests that, all else being equal, industries in which the average worker produces more value added can be expected to pay their workers higher wages than other industries. It is therefore of relevance to examine whether this higher value added is reflected in the relative wages in the IPR\u2011intensive industries.\n\nWages in IPR-intensive industries are indeed higher than in non-IPR\u2011intensive industries. The average weekly wage in IPR-intensive industries is \u20ac 715, compared with \u20ac 507 in non\u2011IPR\u2011intensive industries \u2013 a difference of 41%. This \u201cwage premium\u201d is 31% in design-intensive industries, 42% in trade mark-intensive industries, 46% in GI-intensive industries, 64% in patent-intensive industries and 69% in copyright-intensive industries.\n\nFinally, the role played by IPR-intensive industries in the EU\u2019s external trade is examined. The bulk of EU trade is in IPR-intensive industries. It may be somewhat surprising at first glance that such a high share of imports is IPR-intensive. This is because even industries producing commodities such as energy are IPR-intensive, while on the other hand, many non-IPR-intensive activities are also non-tradable. For that reason, 88% of EU imports consist of products of IPR-intensive industries.\n\nHowever, an even higher share of EU exports, 90% is accounted for by IPR-intensive industries. The EU as a whole had a trade deficit of approximately \u20ac174 billion, or 1.4% of GDP. Since the IPR-intensive industries as a whole account for a higher share of EU exports than EU imports, they make a positive contribution to the Union\u2019s trade position. The EU has a trade deficit in trademark-intensive and patent-intensive products, to some degree offset by trade surpluses in copyright intensive, design-intensive, and GI-intensive industries.",

No similar negative change exists in the data prior to the initiation of the first file-sharing service. Furthermore, we present evidence that this weakened relationship is concentrated among the heaviest music purchasers, and we find no evidence that file sharing led to a widespread increase in music purchases. Nonetheless, our results should be used carefully when predicting the long-term viability of the music industry in an environment where record labels (or artists) compete directly with free file-sharing services.

We empirically study these network effects in the 16-bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting non-cooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega). Thus, our results provide a possible explanation for this situation in which the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) was able to overtake the sales of a firm with a larger network size (Sega).",

We are supporting two main database projects which will also act as exemplars of what good looks like: the Global Repertoire Database in music publishing where Performing Rights Society (PRS for Music) has been a prime motivator and the Global Recording Database with a similar role played by Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL). The aspiration is for collecting societies around the world to be able to draw on one authoritative database which is kept updated (a key requirement for rights databases), replacing multiple databases where the data conflicts and is not kept up to date.\n\n* We are supporting the Linked Content Coalition (LCC), an international project that emanated from the European Publishers Council, but is now moving into new sectors beyond publishing. The LCC is all about developing a common language and a set of communications standards so proper interoperability is achieved, a very real and necessary building block for the Copyright Hub and its associated databases and DCEs.\n\n*We recommend that: The organisations engaged in licensing content to schools and colleges should offer these licences for sale through an intermediary or aggregator thus in effect creating a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 for licensing for educational institutions. This will reduce the number of individual organisations that educational institutions have to deal with to obtain licences (currently around twelve) and should reduce the transaction costs involved in this process.\n\n* We recommend: That the music industry continues to find ways to make the licensing of new digital services over the fixed and mobile internet easier, more automated where appropriate and more accessible. This is and will be done by new types of blanket licensing, by direct licensing and by combinations of blanket and direct licensing. The challenge of direct licensing is to keep the number of different organisations a licensee has to deal with to a sensible minimum. Aggregators and intermediaries play and will play an important role in meeting this challenge.\n\n* That the UK music industry working with the appropriate European organisations continues to pioneer easier ways of licensing across the single European market reducing the number of licensors wherever possible that prospective licensees have to deal with, thus helping to create a true single market across Europe for music.\n\n* We support the ARROW7 and ARROW Plus projects which demonstrate how due diligence in relation to orphan works can be done in an automated way by linking and searching libraries around the world. We especially support the possibility of the technology being usable beyond publishing, for example in the images industry where images without metadata quickly become orphan.\n\n* We recommend that the industries, especially the audiovisual industry where repertoire imbalance is the biggest issue, continue to reduce the problem of repertoire imbalance between the digital and physical worlds and thus counteract the perception of the problem.",

      "abstract": "Content providers from the movie industry argue that peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as KaZaA, Morpheus, or Audiogalaxy are an enormous threat to their business. They blame these networks for their recent decline in sales figures. However, this argument would only apply if consumers can access high quality copies easily and quickly on these networks. This paper presents a simple model outlining the consumers tradeoff between downloading the movie legally or acquiring it illegally through copying from such networks. The model shows that there are mainly two factors affecting consumer demand for copies: the probability of getting high quality copies and the risk associated with copying. The paper goes on to empirically estimate the probability of getting such high quality copies. To date, our results show that there is a very low probability of obtaining high quality movies. We further tested our model by conducting simulation analyses to better understand current and future consumer behavior. The first simulation shows that, with the current low probability of getting high quality copies, the majority of consumers would prefer to download movies legally. The results of the second simulation focusing on the future behavior of consumers showing that the most important factors are: the risk of being caught, the perceived value of the original, the availability (probability) of high quality copies and the price of the original. Our research findings not only offer insight into the consumer behavior, but also to what extent the movie industry faces piracy. These results may serve as a new impulse for copyright holders and policy makers, allowing them to make appropriate decisions and take targeted actions to fight piracy.",

      "abstract": "This is the first large-scale study that looks at artists\u2019 and musicians\u2019 use of the internet and their views on copyright.  The Pew Internet & American Life Project\u2019s \ninterest in studying artists and musicians grew out of our previous work studying internet users\u2019 consumption of music and other creative content online. Through a series of reports on music downloading and file-sharing, we have observed and documented the changing behaviors and attitudes of an American public learning to negotiate the ever-changing copyright landscape of the digital world.\n\nHowever, over the course of observing the explosive growth and persistence of peer-to-\npeer networks, and following the entertainment industry\u2019s ongoing efforts to police these activities and promote licensed digital music services, we found that there were few sources of quantitative research directed at understanding how these issues affect both musicians and the greater creative community. We found ourselves hard-pressed to answer some of the most basic questions about artists and the internet. For instance, how many artists have access to the internet? How many promote and sell their work online? How are they using the internet to develop their work, their connections to other artists, or their connections to audiences and the \nworld-at-large? How do they feel about controversies over copyright and fair use of creative material in the heyday of peer-to-peer systems like the original Napster and the current Kazaa and BitTorrent?  \n\nThe debate about copyright in the digital era has primarily centered on the recording \nindustry\u2019s opposition to unauthorized file-sharing and downloading, a stance that has \nbeen both lauded and criticized by popular musicians. This clash over new technology \ngrows out of a long history of disputes between business and artists about the proper \nbalance between creators, the people who pay for and market creations, and consumers \nwho want access to large catalogs of digital music files and argue that there are many non-infringing uses of peer-to-peer. While music has been at the forefront of this discussion, the movie industry has also recently began suing individual downloaders. \n\nIn our surveys between 2000 and 2003, we found growing numbers of music downloaders who said they didn\u2019t care about the copyright on the files they were acquiring. Technology firms accommodated this demand by creating and marketing an ever-widening array of devices to copy and store music files. Moreover, the growth of home broadband connections has made it progressively easier to share and download \nMP3 files. The recording industry\u2019s response to this apparent apathy towards copyright and the ease of getting free files online was to file more than 7,000 lawsuits directed against alleged file-sharers since September 2003. After the first legal actions by the RIAA, the number of people who said in our surveys that they \ndownloaded music files dropped dramatically but has since rebounded to a degree.\n\nEconomic analysis of recorded music sales data and its relationship to music file-sharing activity is ongoing. At the same time, there is much to be learned from studying developments on the ground level. In the end, the future of any industry whose content can be digitized hinges on the creativity and innovation of artists.  \nBut there are strong concerns within the artistic community, and by prominent legal \nscholars, about the effectiveness of current copyright terms and their enforcement in the online world. Some argue that our understanding of copyright law has strayed far from its original purpose and that the internet calls for an inherently different interpretation of what constitutes copyright infringement and what qualifies as fair use of digitized works. Furthermore, many have raised concerns about the practical difficulties of the permissions process for creators and that too few new works are passing into the public domain. \n\nArtists are avid consumers as well as creators of online content. They often borrow from previous works and use that for inspiration for their own creativity. They represent the leading edge of media consumption online. Yet artists\u2019 perspectives and first-hand experiences with the internet \u2013 both those of musicians and the larger creative community \u2013 have rarely been examined at the national level.\n\nThere are good reasons for this apparent gap in studying artists as consumers as well as producers. They are a notoriously difficult group to define with objective measures and are often prohibitively expensive to contact in large numbers. Musicians, in particular, are often required to travel extensively, which makes them difficult to reach with traditional telephone survey methods. \n\nThe Pew Internet & American Life Project has undertaken several research initiatives to begin to probe these issues of how musicians and artists use the internet and how they feel about the copyright issues that have emerged in the digital age. There were three core research instruments for this study. The findings from these three surveys, while covering similar themes, are discussed in separate sections of the report in order to emphasize the important methodological \ndifferences between the samples. Additionally, each sample serves a different purpose, so we anticipate that some readers will appreciate having the data presented discretely in the sections that follow. \n\nThe national sample of self-identified artists allowed us to ask questions of a broad, random, and representative sample of self-identified artists from around the country, to gather baseline data on internet use by a wide range of artists in the U.S. and probe their opinions on copyright issues online. However, reflecting both the well-known challenges of recruiting artists for research purposes and the conventional wisdom about the small number of career artists in the U.S., this sample was limited in its ability to include a large number of artists who rely almost exclus\nively on artistic work for their livelihood.  \n\nThe sample of online musicians, while not representative, allowed us to reach several \nthousand respondents, including a substantial portion of career musicians (those we \ndefine as \u201cSuccess Stories\u201d and \u201cStarving Musicians\u201d in the report) who have a \nconsiderable stake in discussing both the positive and negative effects of free \ndownloading online. The musician survey, because it was administered online, also gave us a chance to ask a more thorough list of questions about the internet that was uniquely catered to musical performers and songwriters.  \n\nFinally, the random and nationally representative sample of American adults provided a glimpse of how the views and experiences of average consumers compare to those of the creative public.",

      "abstract": "Based on a survey questionnaire administered to 1478 R&D labs in the U.S. manufacturing sector in 1994, we find that firms typically protect the profits due to invention with a range of mechanisms, including patents, secrecy, lead time advantages and the use of complementary marketing and manufacturing capabilities. Of these mechanisms, however, patents tend to be the least emphasized by firms in the majority of manufacturing industries, and secrecy and lead time tend to be emphasized most heavily. A comparison of our results with the earlier survey findings of Levin et al. (1987) suggests that patents may be relied upon somewhat more heavily by larger firms now than in the early 1980s. For the protection of product innovations, secrecy now appears to be be much more heavily employed across most industries than previously. Our results on the motives for patent indicate that firms patent for reasons that often extend beyond directly profiting from a patented innovation through either its commercialization or licensing. In addition to the prevention of copying, the most prominent motives for patenting include the prevention of rivals from patenting related inventions (i.e., \"patent blocking\"), the use of patents in negotiations and the prevention of suits. We find that firms commonly patent for different reasons in \"discrete\" product industries, such as telecommunications equipment or semiconductors. In the former, firms appear to use their patents commonly to block the development of substitute by rivals, and in the latter, firms are much more likely to use patents to force rivals into negotiations.",

      "abstract": "Peer-to-Peer networking technology and related innovations have had a major impact on the music and motion picture industries. While digital technology has improved the quality of audio and video recordings and decreased distribution costs, it has also made unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material and its transmission over the Internet easier. The media industry attributes an erosion of its sales after 1999 to the illegal copying and sharing of digital files and has taken steps to tighten copyright laws and prosecute violators. Others attribute the downturn to a lack of innovative products and futile efforts by the industry to retain a business model made obsolete by technological innovation. In the meantime, unauthorized file-sharing via Peer-to-Peer networks continues unabated and its real financial impact on the industry remains unclear. The market perceives illegal file-sharing to be a significant threat to the long-term profitability of the media industry and regards current legal initiatives to protect its intellectual capital as beneficial.

      "abstract": "In the early days of digital reproduction and internet communication technologies, technological protection measures were deemed to prevent potential copying of copyrighted works by the users of such technologies. However, the most of technological protection measures used so far were quickly circumvented after their introduction. This led to the development and use of more and more advanced technological protection measures, which were also quickly circumvented after their introduction. Therefore, the conventional view on the efficiency of using technological protection measures is that their use leads to a vicious circle of their circumvention and upgrading. \n\nTo examine the efficiency of technological protection measures, we conducted an online survey in Japan. A random sample of 1,252 internet users was asked to respond to a series of multiple-choice questions on their consumption of copyrighted works and their acceptance of or objection to selected restrictions on various uses of copyrighted works. By analyzing collected data, we identified that an individual\u2019s decision on the acceptance or rejection of such technological and other restrictions on using copyrighted works is affected by factors such as gender, type of copyrighted works, perception of justified use, and actual use of copyright works. In addition, we observed considerable differences between the importance of individual types of copyrighted works and their uses for consumers. Some types of copyrighted works and their uses were more important for respondents than others. In many cases, the respondents\u2019 judgments were consistent with the current copyright law and practice in Japan. However, there are several significant issues where their judgment considerably differs, especially with regard to recent changes in Japanese copyright law aiming to strengthen copyright enforcement in the digital environment. This can considerably undermine the efficiency of those changes in copyright law.",

      "abstract": "This paper quantifies the magnitude of changes in household-level expenditures on recorded music in the United States, particularly attributed to the emergence of Napster.Exploiting the rich information contained in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, I use three approaches to measure the effect of Napster. The difference-in-difference kernel matching (DDM) method directly quantifies the effect. I find that the quarterly music expenditure of the average\nU.S. household has declined by two dollars and forty-six cents as a result of using the Internet and plausibly Napster. This accounts for 33% of the decrease in total recording sales in 2000. The second approach estimates a demand system for entertainment goods. The estimated cross-price elasticities imply that changes in prices of other entertainment goods also explain the slump in recorded music sales. In 2000, roughly 37% of the decline in recording sales is due to such changes in prices. The final method constructs synthetic cohorts. The results indicate that transition from LPs to CDs might describe the increase in music sales during the 1990\u2019s as well as the recent slowdown. These two other methods\nindirectly measure the effect of Napster in that they explicate that more than 80% of music sales decrease in 2000 might have resulted from factors aside from Napster. This implies that the estimated magnitude using DDM may quantify changes in the household-level music expenditure due to not only Napster but also factors other than file-sharing of copyrighted music.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this evaluation is to assess whether the policy goals of Directive 96/9/EC on\nthe legal protection of databases1 (the \u201cDirective\u201d) have been achieved and, in particular,\nwhether the creation of a special \u201csui generis\" right has had adverse effects on competition.\nThis is the first time that the Directive is subject to an evaluation. The aim of the Directive was to remove existing differences in the legal protection of databases by harmonising the rules that applied to copyright protection, safeguard the investment of database makers and ensure that the legitimate interests of users to access information compiled in databases were secured.\n\nAt the time of its adoption, the Commission reasoned that differences in the standard of\n\u201coriginality\u201d required for a database to enjoy copyright protection impeded the free movement\nof \u201cdatabase products\u201d across the Community. In particular, the Commission argued that the\ndifference between the lower \u201csweat of the brow\u201d copyright standard (i.e. involving\nconsiderable skill, labour or judgment in gathering together and/or checking a compilation)\nthat applied in common law Member States and the higher \u201cintellectual creation\u201d standard\nthat applied in droit d\u2019auteur Member States created distortion of trade in \u201cdatabase\nproducts\u201d.\n\nIn essence, the Directive sought to create a legal framework that would establish the ground\nrules for the protection of a wide variety of databases in the information age. It did so by\ngiving a high level of copyright protection to certain databases (\u201coriginal\u201d databases) and a\nnew form of \u201csui generis\u201d protection to those databases which were not \u201coriginal\u201d in the sense\nof the author's own intellectual creation (\u201cnon-original\u201d databases).\nThe approach chosen in the Directive was to harmonise the threshold of \u201coriginality\u201d. Those\n\u201cnon-original\u201d databases that did not meet the threshold would be protected by a newly\ncreated right.\n\u2013 In a first step, this was done by adopting the higher standard that applied in droit d\u2019auteur\ncountries, which had the effect of protecting fewer databases by copyright (which was now\nlimited to so-called \u201coriginal\u201d databases);\n\u2013 In a second step, for those databases that would previously have enjoyed protection under\nthe \u201csweat of the brow\u201d copyright, but no longer according to the harmonised \u201coriginality\u201d\nstandard, a new right was created \u2013 the \u201csui generis\u201d right to prevent extraction and reutilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of a database in which there\nhas been substantial investment (\u201cnon-original\u201d databases).\n\nWhile \u201coriginal\u201d databases require an element of \u201cintellectual creation\u201d, \u201cnon-original\u201d\ndatabases are protected as long as there has been \u201cqualitatively or quantitatively a substantial\ninvestment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\u201d of a database.\nThe \u201csui generis\u201d right is a Community creation with no precedent in any international\nconvention. No other jurisdiction makes a distinction between \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201cnon-original\u201d\ndatabases.",

Introduced to stimulate the production of databases in Europe, the new instrument has had no proven impact on the production of databases. Data taken from the GDD (see Section 4.2.3) show that the EU database production in 2004 has fallen back to pre-Directive levels: the number of EU-based database \u201centries\u201d into the GDD6 was 3095 in 2004 as compared to 3092 in 1998. In 2001, there were 4085 EU-based \u201centries\u201d while in 2004 there were only 3095.\n\nIs \u201csui generis\u201d protection therefore necessary for a thriving database industry? The empirical\nevidence, at this stage, casts doubts on this necessity. The European publishing industry, which was consulted in a restricted online survey, however produced strong submissions arguing that \u201csui generis\u201d protection was crucial to the continued success of their activities. In addition, most respondents to the on-line survey (see Section 4.2.2) believe that the \u201csui generis\u201d right has brought about legal certainty, reduced the costs associated with the protection of databases, created more business opportunities and facilitated the marketing of databases.\n\nAt this stage, the evaluation concludes that repealing the Directive altogether or repealing the\n\u201csui generis\u201d right in isolation would probably lead to considerable resistance by the EU\ndatabase industry which wishes to retain \u201csui generis\u201d protection for factual compilations.

Importantly, unlike fair use, this exception can only apply to a use of copyright material for one of the prescribed purposes. The purposes are not illustrative.\n\nStatutory Licences\n*Recommendation 8\u20131 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material which, because of another provision of the Act, would not infringe copyright. This means that governments, educational institutions and institutions assisting people with disability, will be able to rely on unremunerated exceptions, including fair use or the new fair dealing exception, to the extent that they apply.\n*Recommendation 8\u20132 The Copyright Act should be amended to clarify that the statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 do not apply to a use of copyright material where a government, educational institution, or an institution assisting people with disability, instead relies on an alternative licence, whether obtained directly from rights holders or from a collecting society.\n*Recommendation 8\u20133 The Copyright Act should be amended to remove any requirement that, to rely on the statutory licence in pt VII div 2, governments must notify or pay equitable remuneration to a declared collecting society. Governments should have the option to notify and pay equitable remuneration directly to rights holders, where this is possible.\n*Recommendation 8\u20134 The statutory licences in pts VA, VB and VII div 2 of the Copyright Act should be made less prescriptive. Detailed provisions concerning the setting of equitable remuneration, remuneration notices, records notices, sampling notices, and record keeping should be removed. The Act should not require sampling surveys to be conducted. Instead, the Act should simply provide that the amount of equitable remuneration and other terms of the licences should be agreed between the relevant parties, or failing agreement, determined by the Copyright Tribunal.\n\nQuotation\n*Recommendation 9\u20131 The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a quotation infringes copyright.\n\nPrivate Use and Social Use\n*Recommendation 10\u20131 The exceptions for format shifting and time shifting in ss 47J, 109A, 110AA and 111 of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a private use infringes copyright.\n\nIncidental or Technical Use and Data and Text Mining\n*Recommendation 11\u20131 The exceptions for temporary uses and proxy web caching in ss 43A, 111A, 43B, 111B and 200AAA of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether incidental or technical uses infringes copyright.\n\nLibraries and Archives\n*Recommendation 12\u20131 Section 200AB of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether uses by libraries and archives infringes copyright.\n*Recommendation 12\u20132 The exceptions for preservation copying in ss 51A, 51B, 110B, 110BA and 112AA of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception that permits libraries and archives to use copyright material for preservation purposes. The exception should not limit the number or format of copies that may be made.\n\nOrphan Works\n*Recommendation 13\u20131 The Copyright Act should be amended to limit the remedies available in an action for infringement of copyright, where it is established that, at the time of the infringement:\n(a) a reasonably diligent search for the rights holder had been conducted and the rights holder had not been found; and\n(b) as far as reasonably possible, the user of the work has clearly attributed it to the author.\n*Recommendation 13\u20132 The Copyright Act should provide that, in determining whether a reasonably diligent search was conducted, regard may be had to, among other things:\n(a) the nature of the copyright material;\n(b) how and by whom the search was conducted;\n(c) the search technologies, databases and registers available at the time; and\n(d) any guidelines, protocols or industry practices about conducting diligent searches available at the time.\n\nEducation\n*Recommendation 14\u20131 The exceptions for educational use in ss 28, 44, 200, 200AAA and 200AB of the Copyright Act should be repealed. The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether an educational use infringes copyright.\n\nGovernment Use\n*Recommendation 15\u20131 The parliamentary libraries exceptions in ss 48A, 50(1)(aa) and 104 of the Copyright Act should be extended to apply to all types of copyright material and all exclusive rights.\n*Recommendation 15\u20132 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for the purpose of the proceedings of a tribunal, or for reporting those proceedings.\n*Recommendations 17\n*Recommendation 15\u20133 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for the purpose of the proceedings of a royal commission or a statutory inquiry, or for reporting those proceedings.\n*Recommendation 15\u20134 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for uses where statutes require local, state or Commonwealth governments to provide public access to copyright material.\n*Recommendation 15\u20135 The Copyright Act should provide for a new exception for use of correspondence and other material sent to government. This exception should not extend to uses that make previously published material publicly available.\n\nAccess for People with Disability\n*Recommendation 16\u20131 The fair use or new fair dealing exception should be applied when determining whether a use for access for people with disability infringes copyright.\n\nRetransmission of Free-to-air Broadcasts\n*Recommendation 18\u20131 In developing media and communications policy, and in responding to media convergence, the Australian Government should consider whether the retransmission scheme for free-to-air broadcasts provided by pt VC of the Copyright Act and s 212(2) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) should be repealed.\nNote: This would effectively leave the extent to which retransmission occurs entirely to negotiation between the parties\u2014broadcasters, retransmitters and underlying copyright holders.\nRecommendation 18\u20132 If the retransmission scheme is retained, the scope and application of the internet exclusion in s 135ZZJA of the Copyright Act should be clarified.\n\nBroadcasting\n*Recommendation 19\u20131 In developing media and communications policy, and in responding to media convergence, the Australian Government should consider whether the following exceptions in the Copyright Act should be repealed:\n(a) s 45\u2014broadcast of extracts of works;\n(b) ss 47, 70 and 107\u2014reproduction for broadcasting;\n(c) s 109\u2014broadcasting of sound recordings;\n(d) ss 65 and 67\u2014incidental broadcast of artistic works; and\n(e) s 199\u2014reception of broadcasts.\n*Recommendation 19\u20132 The Australian Government should also consider whether the following exceptions should be amended to extend to the transmission of linear television or radio programs using the internet or other forms of communication to the public:\n(a) s 47A\u2014sound broadcasting by holders of a print disability radio licence; and\n(b) pt VA\u2014copying of broadcasts by educational institutions.\n\nContracting Out\n*Recommendation 20\u20131 The Copyright Act should provide that any term of an agreement that restricts or prevents the doing of an act, which would otherwise be permitted by specific libraries and archives exceptions, is unenforceable.\n*Recommendation 20\u20132 The Copyright Act should not provide statutory limitations on contracting out of the fair use exception. However, if fair use is not enacted, limitations on contracting out should apply to the new fair dealing exception.",

It should therefore not be surprising that fair use and each of its illustrative purposes, and the handful of specific exceptions recommended in this Report, have much in common. Generally, they permit the unlicensed use of copyright material if this would:\n\u2022 serve an important public purpose;\n\u2022 stimulate the creation of new works and the use of existing works for new purposes; and\n\u2022 not harm rights holders\u2019 markets\u2014ensuring exceptions do not undermine the crucial incentive to create and publish copyright material.",

The research arose primarily from the recommendations of the Hargreaves Review which was quite explicit in pointing to orphan works as a major problem of untapped resources in the UK.  \n\nWithin this context the aims of the study were to carry out some qualitative research in the UK\nwith organisations that had an interest in orphan works and had previously been consulted by\nIPO. The main aim was to consult on the views of interested parties and in particular discuss\nthe perceived benefits, disbenefits, and changes in use patterns from their perspective.  In parallel with this research, IPO has commissioned further research on the use of orphan works schemes and pricing issues which has been carried out by Bournemouth University.\n\nAt the time of the research the details of potential proposals to be put forward by the Government\nfor an orphan works scheme were not known in full, but there had been consultations as part of\nthe Hargreaves Review and subsequently. Hence the results are qualified by this, and need to\nbe viewed in this context.",

Hence, there could be wider economic benefits and some stimulation of growth. The main benefits to society were considered to be increased access to materials, training and educational benefits. The disbenefits were potentially that the system could be too complex and cumbersome, and licenses could take too long to be issued. It was considered that there would be an increase in demand for orphan work material.\n\nThe main economic benefits were considered to be increases in competitiveness, income and\nrevenue, especially for the media sector. The main benefits to society were through the increase\nin access to material which improved education and training, and the choice of services for the\npublic.\n\nOverseas organisations did not identify many disbenefits. The main ones were that the process\nto obtain use could take too long, and the system could be complex. The issue of legal\nchallenges was not raised as a disbenefit. The orphan works systems had increased the supply of useable materials primarily because of a reduced risk of copyright infringement, and greater certainty and confidence.

      "abstract": "The United States has the most innovative and influential music culture in the world, but much of the legal framework for licensing of music dates back to the early part of the twentieth century, long before the digital revolution in music. Our licensing system is founded on a view that the music marketplace requires a unique level of government regulation, much of it reflected in statutory licensing provisions of the Copyright Act. The Copyright Office believes that the time is ripe to question the existing paradigm for the licensing of musical works and sound recordings and consider meaningful change.\n\nThere is a widespread perception that our licensing system is broken. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned that they cannot make a living under the existing structure, which raises serious and systemic concerns for the future. Music publishers and performance rights organizations are frustrated that so much of their licensing activity is subject to government control, so they are constrained in the marketplace. Record labels and digital services complain that the licensing process is burdensome and inefficient, making it difficult to innovate.\n\nWhile there is general consensus that the system needs attention, there is less agreement as to what should be done. In this report, after reviewing the existing framework and stakeholders\u2019 views, the Copyright Office offers a series of guiding principles and preliminary recommendations for change. The Office\u2019s proposals are meant to be contemplated together, rather than individually. With this approach, the Office seeks to present a series of balanced tradeoffs among the interested parties to create a fairer, more efficient, and more rational system for all.",

Having considered the plethora of issues that plague our current licensing system\u2014and how they might practically be addressed\u2014the Office has identified some additional principles that it believes should also guide any process of reform.

First, with respect to orphan works, referred to as 'perhaps the single greatest impediment to creating new works,' a user's ability to seek permission or to negotiate licensing terms is compromised by the fact that, despite his or her diligent efforts, the user cannot identify or locate the copyright owner. Second, in the case of mass digitization \u2013 which involves making reproductions of many works, as well as possible efforts to make the works publicly accessible \u2013 obtaining permission is essentially impossible, not necessarily because of a lack of identifying information or the inability to contact the copyright owner, but because of the sheer number of individual permissions required.",

Given fairly recent changes in the international policy ethos where a regime of stronger intellectual property protection has become a fait accompli for most developing countries (and the developed too), it is of some significance to ask whether more stringent protection of intellectual property does indeed encourage innovation. And this is the question which this paper examines, utilising cross\u2010country panel data on R&D investment, patent protection and other country\u2010specific characteristics spanning the period 1981\u201395.

This 4-year period spans essentially the entire history of online Apache help. The Usenet log data was obtained from a World Wide Web service called Deja.com (since acquired by Google). This service archives all of the discussion groups on the World Wide Usenet and makes available advanced search and parsing capability through their website (http://groups.google.com).\n\n*The authors collected questionnaire data from people who posted either questions or answers to CIWS-U during the 4.5 months from 1 October 1999 to 15 February 2000. During this time period, they monitored activity on CIWS-U near-continuously via computer. Within 3 days of when a question or an answer was posted on CIWS-U, a computer automatically detected whether the individual was posting a question (e.g. was starting a new \u201cthread\u201d) or was providing information related to a previously posted question (e.g. was referring to an existing thread in his or her posting). It then sent a version of a questionnaire (one appropriate to information seeking or one appropriate to information providing) to the email address of that individual. The e-mail contained a brief introduction to the study, a link to the individual\u2019s actual posting on CIWS-U and a link to a password protected website that contained the survey. This \u201cautomatic\u201d data collection method had the advantage of allowing the authors to obtain information from posters on a near real-time basis \u2014 while recollections regarding what they did and why they did it was still fresh. Upon completion of each questionnaire, the individual answers were archived to a protected database as well as e-mailed to the authors.\n\n*This process identified 1709 total participants, yielding 336 usable responses (214 information seekers and 122 information providers).",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the most accurate empirical study to date to characterize and quantify the amount of content of various types that is transferred worldwide using BitTorrent, the dominant peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application. Using data we collected from the largest public BitTorrent tracker over 106 days between August 2010 and February 2011 and a new methodology, we find that for some content types, the number of copies transferred is an order of magnitude greater than the number sold through legal channels. For example, we estimate that 10.7 songs were transferred using BitTorrent for every song sold, 3.6 movies were transferred using BitTorrent for every legal sale or rental of a DVD or Blu-ray, and 227 movies were transferred using BitTorrent for every paid download. We also find that the vast majority of music and video content transferred using BitTorrent is copyrighted, as demonstrated both by the swarm metadata we observed, and the fact that only 0.55% of the transfers were of files indexed by websites that specialize in content that can be transferred legally.\nThis article assesses what and how much content is transferred using BitTorrent, currently the most popular file sharing P2P protocol in use, with the purpose of fulfilling three objectives. The first objective is to provide a reasonable empirically derived lower bound for the number of copies of copyrighted titles transferred using BitTorrent.  The second objective is to break that lower bound down into categories depending on characteristics of\ncontent transferred.  The third objective is to understand which content formats and technical characteristics of content (different methods of video digitalization, video resolutions and audio bit rates) users prefer.",

Songs and software, despite being shared in small percentages of swarms (4.5% and 7.2% of swarms respectively), rank 2nd and 3rd in terms of transfers (with 20.4% and 16.8% of transfers respectively).\n* This demonstrates limitations of past studies that estimated the economic impact of P2P by looking at which content is available rather than trying to measure the number of actual transfers. Surprisingly, most of the copies transferred using BitTorrent come from a small number of extremely popular titles; 37 song titles account for half of all songs transferred, and 117 movies account half of all movie transfers. Thus, for a global marketplace, the importance of the \u201clong tail\u201d of less popular content is smaller than we and others have observed in more localized studies. In general, the content that is popular in legal channels is also popular with BitTorrent, but we observe some important differences.

Increases in royalty payments and R&D expenditures are more than 20 percent larger among affiliates of parent companies that use U.S. patents more extensively prior to reform and therefore are expected to value IPR reform most.

Software piracy rates are related to various economic variables and two measures of social construct. The study includes an individualism score, which measures horizontal social relationships, and a measure of power distance, measuring vertical social relationships. It is found that economic variables do play a role in the decision to pirate software and that increased power-distance, or the further individuals feel from their superiors, for example law enforcement officials, the greater the propensity to pirate software.",

      "abstract": "The Resale Right Directive (2001/84/EC of 27 September 2001) ('the Directive') was conceived with two major objectives in mind: to \"ensure that authors of graphic and plastic works of art share in the economic success of their original works of art\"1 on the one hand and, on the other, to harmonise the application of the right across the EU. It was considered that \"The application or non-application of such a right has a significant impact on the competitive environment within the internal market, since the existence or absence of an obligation to pay on the basis of the resale right is an element which must be taken into account by each individual wishing to sell a work of art. This right is therefore a factor which contributes to the creation of distortions of competition as well as displacement of sales within the Community.\"\n\nConsistent with these aims, the Directive promoted harmonisation of the substantive conditions for the application of the resale right: (i) eligibility and the duration of protection; (ii) the categories of works of art to which the resale right applies; (iii) the scope of the acts to\nbe covered i.e. all acts involving dealers in works of art; (iv) the royalty rates applicable across defined price bands; (v) the maximum threshold for a minimum resale price attracting\nthe right (\u20ac3,000); and (vi) provisions on third country nationals entitled to receive royalties. The Directive came into force on 1 January 2006.\n\nAt the time the Directive was agreed 4 of the then 15 Member States did not apply the resale right in national law: Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These Member States enjoyed a transitional period to 1 January 2010 during which they could choose not to apply the resale right to the works of eligible deceased artists. These Member States, together with Malta, made use of this provision, and of the option to extend the derogation period for a further 2 years. This derogation comes to an end on 1 January 2012, at which point the Directive must be fully implemented in all Member States.\n\nArticle 11 of the Directive foresees that the Commission should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the implementation and the effect of the Directive. This report answers to that requirement. In line with the provisions of Article 11 this Report examines in particular the impact of the Directive on the internal market and the effect of the introduction of the resale right in those Member States that did not apply the right in national law prior to the entry into force of this Directive. It pays particular attention to the position of the Community in relation to relevant markets that do not apply the resale right, assesses the role of the Directive in the fostering of artistic creativity and reviews the situation with regard to the management procedures in the Member States.",

Neither can any clear patterns currently be established that would indicate systematic trade diversion within the EU away from those Member States which introduced the right for living artists in 2006. Nevertheless, there are clearly pressures on European art markets, in all price ranges, and for both the auction and dealer sectors, and it is recalled that the scope of the application of the resale right will be significantly expanded following the ending of the derogation for the works of deceased artists on 1 January 2012.\nAt the same time, the quality of the administration of the resale right appears to vary considerably across the EU, bringing costs to art market professionals and artists alike. The burden can be particularly high for those at the lower end of the market who are proportionately more deeply affected by the costs of administering the right. The Commission recognises, furthermore, that in some Member States inefficient administration of the resale right presents a not insignificant burden on art market professionals and may also lead to unnecessarily high deductions from the royalties due to artists and their successors.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, as Congress has created new intellectual property (IP) rights and courts have often interpreted those rights broadly, legal scholars have frequently decried the expanded scope of protection afforded IP owners in most substantive areas of IP law. According to this critique, the over-expansion of IP rights throughout the past two decades harms competition, chills free speech, and diminishes the public domain as increasingly broad areas of social life are brought within the scope of strong IP protection. While this over-expansion theory reflects an important - indeed, foundational - policy debate concerning the proper balance between IP owners' rights and the public's rights of access to the information, ideas, and expressions\nthat IP protects, it is incomplete because it focuses largely on what Congress or the courts do. In reality, most enforcement of IP rights takes place not in court, but in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. \"Cease and desist\" letters, phone calls, and negotiations with alleged infringers constitute the bulk of IP enforcement efforts in trademark and copyright practice. To be sure, these efforts take place in the \"shadow\" of IP law and are therefore influenced by it. But it is in these everyday practices - and not in trial or appellate courts - that most IP rights are asserted, resisted, and negotiated. Thus, if we want to know whether IP rights are over-enforced or over-extended, we need to know how, why, and to what effect these\nrights are exercised in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. To date, however, IP scholarship has focused virtually no attention on this critical arena of everyday practice. This Article presents findings from a qualitative empirical study of the trademark and copyright disputing process outside of court, based on original data derived from semi-structured interviews with experienced\nIP attorneys who advise clients on how to enforce their rights. This research is one of the first studies to examine how trademark and copyright claims are actually enforced in practice. One significant finding from this study is that \"repeat player\" trademark and copyright owners (and their lawyers) knowingly assert weak IP claims at times - precisely because it works, as enforcement targets are unable or unwilling to resist claims that may lack legal merit due to the costs and uncertainties of threatened litigation. Moreover, the lawyers who assert weak IP claims have ready practical and ethical justifications for their actions. This study also suggests that legal sanctions directed at deterring over-reaching IP enforcement are unlikely to be effective because most such over-reaching occurs in informal disputing processes outside of the legal system.",

Software piracy permits the shadow discussion of a software parallel to its legal diffusion in the marketplace, increasing its user base over time. Because of its software shadow difussion a software user base, opportunities for cross-selling, and marketing its other products and new generations of the software. Software pirates may influence potential software users to adopt the software, and some of these adopters may become buyers. A diffusion modelling approach is suggested to track shadow diffusion and the legal diffusion of a software over time. The approach enables management to estimate (1) the pirated options over time and(2) the percentage of legal adoptions due to the influence of pirates. The modelling approach is applied to study the diffusion of two types of software (spreadsheets and word processors) in the United Kingdom. The results suggests that although six of every seven software users utilized pirate copies, these pirates were responsible for generating more than 80% of new software buyers, thereby significantly influencing the legal diffusion of software.

Yet, stars and\nblockbusters in the domestic market do not seem to have a positive effect on the US exports of motion pictures, possibly because of differing taste driven by cultural differences.

      "abstract": "Despite considerable research suggesting that creators value attribution \u2013 that is, being named as the creator of a work \u2013 U.S. intellectual property (IP) law does not provide a right to attribution to the vast majority of creators. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are much more complicated.\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to measure quantitatively the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a \u201ccreativity effect\u201d that results in their assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced: creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be restructured to provide attribution as a creator\u2019s default right.\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default, they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, paradoxically, our findings suggest that we should exercise caution before we restructure U.S. law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators. Indeed, it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting.\nFinally, our findings have implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.",

This research provides quantitative empirical evidence for the notion that creators significantly value attribution.\n\n*It does not necessarily follow that the U.S. should include a right to attribution in the law simply because creators value it. From a utilitarian perspective, attribution, just like any other aspect of IP rights, should be assigned in such a way that it is likely to reduce transaction costs and generate efficient bargains. \n\n*In light of the findings of the third experiment, the research seems to undermine utilitarian arguments for creating a waivable attribution right.",

      "proposition": "Main results:\n\n*The photographers behaved similarly to the poets and painters in the authors' previous experiments, and set their WTA significantly higher than their expected mean value.\n\n*For amateur photographers, the prospect of publication with attribution results in a significantly lower 'Willingness To Accept' (WTA) compared to the WTA reported by subjects in the Contest and Publication conditions pooled together. This finding suggests that the prospect of publication with attribution has a modest but nonetheless statistically significant effect of reducing WTA compared to a situation where subjects are not offered the prospect of publication with attribution.\n\n*Given the strong preference for attribution, publication without attribution may be viewed negatively, which would account for the higher average WTA in the Publication condition versus the Contest condition (although this was not significant at the 0.05 confidence level).\n\n*The data also suggest that professional and advanced amateur photographers place a somewhat greater value on the prospect of publication with attribution compared with their amateur counterparts. The professional subjects\u2019 WTA in the Attribution condition was lower by a significant amount compared to the Contest subjects\u2019 WTA. This is fairly strong evidence that creators attach some substantial value to credited publication of their work.\n\n*The creators\u2019 behavior indicates that they valued attribution at $415.07. The professional and advanced amateur photographers value attribution far more than the casual snapshooters.\n\n*In the third experiment, subjects altered the amount of money they were willing to accept in ways that were consistent with placing a significant economic value on attribution.\n\n*This study suggests that a waivable default attribution rule could have a significant \u2013 and negative \u2013 effect on the efficiency of markets to license IP.\n\n*When the subjects were initially endowed with a right to attribution, they valued it substantially more than they did when they were not so endowed and had to purchase it. In the study, subjects valued attribution four times higher under the Default Attribution condition than when the default was no attribution.",

      "abstract": "The basic reason for protection of intellectual property rights is the necessity to encourage and support innovation and to promote the creation of knowledge. Intellectual property has a functional effect on the creation, development and innovation of the intellectual products which improve our life. Software piracy is one of the important parts of the digital piracy problem, and according to Swinward et al. (1990), software was also the first copyrighted product that was duplicated on a large scale. BSA defined software piracy as the illegal copying, downloading, sharing, selling or installing of copyrighted software.\nIt is difficult to measure accurately the worldwide magnitude of the software piracy problem. According to the Business Software Alliance (BSA) Global Software Piracy Report, the rate of software piracy in 2009 was 43%. This is a serious problem for the world economy, but the problem is more serious in Turkey. According to the BSA 2009 Global Software Piracy Report, the software piracy rate in Turkey was 63% in 2009. If the assumption is made that every instance of pirated software usage equals an amount of loss in the economy, then the impact of the loss on the Turkish economy was 415 million dollars. Before advanced technology and high speed Internet, software piracy was carried out by copying disks or other types of physical objects, but now almost all types of software piracy occur over the Internet.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the factors that contribute to pirated software usage among Turkish Internet users in order to define the dynamics behind the problem of software piracy from the Internet users\u2019 perspective. Definition of the reasons behind an existing problem is a crucial part of the problem solving process. With this study the factors behind the problem of pirated software usage will be empirically analyzed from the users\u2019 perspective by applying Routine Activity Theory. According to RAT, three major factors that affect criminal activities include access to suitable targets, motivated offenders and the absence of capable guardians. According to the routine activity approach, crime or the risk of crime increases when a motivated offender identifies or encounters a suitable target in the absence of a capable guardian.",

      "abstract": "Modern copyright law is based upon a theory: increase copyright protection and you increase the number of creative works available to society. This theory has been the driving force behind an economic vision that has expanded, beyond all recognition, the original law created by the Statute of Anne. And with this expansion, we are told that the costs associated with copyright are worthwhile because of the bounty it produces. What if this theory could be tested? After all, this is not a question of faith or morality, nor is it a statement on how humans should behave; it is a theory about how humans do behave. In this article, we use statistical analysis to test the theory that increasing copyright protection usually increases the number of new creative works. Relying upon U.S. copyright registrations from 1870 through 2006 as a proxy for the number of works created, we considered how four variables, population, the economy, law changes, and technology influenced subsequent copyright registrations. Based upon this data, our findings cast serious doubt on the idea that with copyright law, one size fits all. While individual law changes may be associated with changes in subsequent copyright registrations, overall, the relationship between law changes and registrations is neither consistent nor completely predictable.",

Our search strategy maximised the breadth of literature regarding UFS from English language academic and grey literature. \u201cGrey literature\u201d refers to any research not published in academic journals. For example government or industry reports, as well as academic research that has not been published.Keywords were developed that combined a range of methods of sharing with relevant types of content that could be shared.\nDue to search string incompatibility a reduced search was performed in the Westlaw database. It was \u201c(piracy OR file sharing) AND (music OR books OR video games OR film OR television OR pornography)\u201d. To capture pre-publication articles, the database of working papers \u201cSocial Science Research Network\u201d was searched for the past four full years (2009\u20132013) using the keywords \u201cfile sharing\u201d and \u201cpiracy\u201d. This database does not support Boolean operators and the two searches were run separately and manually combined. Searches were performed and articles extracted from the 20th to 27th of February 2013.\nOne author (SJW) screened the titles of all identified articles. After excluding obviously irrelevant articles, two authors (SJW and PF) independently screened a random sample of 100 abstracts for inclusion.\nA large majority of the initially identified studies were excluded, this is common when searches are highly sensitive [12]. Fig 1 summarizes the inclusion and exclusion process for all articles identified through electronic databases. Reasons for excluding 134 articles at full text review were, not being an empirical study (46), not being relevant (43), being a duplicate publication (37), only examining exchanges which included a financial transfer (7), and one study was excluded for being in a foreign language. This left 195 articles to be included in the review, though only 192 were useable. Three studies did not provide data that could be synthesized into any of the categories of our conceptual framework and so were not used further. They only compared UFS attitudes and behavior depending upon occupation [20], provided a typology of those that UFS but without presenting sufficient information for the individual factors that determined this typology to be extracted and combined with similar studies [21], or else provided insufficient description of the variables included in their model to permit accurate classification of included factors [22]. One hundred and twenty-two reports were identified from the grey literature, of which 108 were excluded. The reasons for exclusion were not being empirical (48), not being relevant (43), being a duplicate publication of an already identified article (13), only examining exchanges of media which included a financial transfer (2), and being published in a foreign language (2). This included an additional 14 articles in the review. Therefore the final number of studies included in the review is 192 + 14 = 206.",

Extending the growing field of user entrepreneurship, we identify a two-phase approach to industry entry by user entrepreneurs who start \u201cunder the radar\u201d of incumbent firms, gain experience, attract a first potential customer base, and then, in a second phase, engage in commercialization. During this process, a community of fellow users is of major importance for the entrepreneur, serving as a knowledge pool for skills development and experimentation with different commercialization paths. We study a nascent group of firms founded by users of video games who became entrepreneurs on entering the animation industry by producing Machinima, a new film genre characterized by shooting film in video games. We explain how user entrepreneurs gain access to complementary assets (video games) for their new use (shooting film), how they deal with intellectual property issues when using other firms\u2019 assets, and how user entrepreneurs combine domain knowledge about film production with their experience in video games and the art of Machinima. Our propositions hold implications for management and policy.\n\n\n== Propositions ==\n\n- There is a potential relevance of assets for user entrepreneurs\u2019 entry into commercial marketplaces, while there is also a nascent group of firms that contribute to developing a new genre in the industry they enter, which underscores the novelty of their products and the associated risks of IP infringement.\n\n- Selective sharing may apply to different types of asset (game engine, artwork, toolkits, etc.), which in turn represent different trade-offs for the user entrepreneur in terms of gaining access to, or substituting for, the asset; however, commercialising with others\u2019 assets in a new industry remains an understudied area.\n\n- User innovation occurs in communities, where individual domain knowledge is brought to avoid technical problems, share solutions, promote work, and develop or improve technology.\n\n- Entrepreneurs' domain knowledge relevant to commercialisation plays a key role in bringing innovations to industry as products.\n\n== Method ==\n \n- Multiple, non-embedded [[case study]], [[interviews]]\n\n== Discipline ==\n \n- [[Management studies]]\n\n== Data ==\n\n- Interviews with 25 creators and entrepreneurs, digital content analysis\n\n== Interventions-Response ==\n\n- Two-stage entry (first under the radar of incumbent firms and then commercialisation) into the animation industry can be helpful in avoiding: i) apparent conflict over IP rights by first relying on informal copyright practices, and ii) large investments in established distribution channels by using the Internet.\n\n- User innovation rests on the advantage provided by sticky knowledge and users\u2019 local perception of their own and their community\u2019s needs, while user entrepreneurs effectively leverage community knowledge for entry into new industries.\n\n- Users diffuse technologies across industry boundaries depending on their assessment of the components of the technology, on their own costs of re-creating it, and on the outcome of the negotiations with the owners of the IP rights to the technology, which may in turn be a question of timing.\n\n- While the user community of Machinimators was instrumental in diffusing knowledge about the application of video games to animation production, process and business knowledge (sequel and storyline development, distribution channels) were revealed to a far lesser extent, which is consistent with both the atomistic versus collective user entrepreneurship and the logic of selective revealing.",

The law has severely reduced the possibility of such recordings entering into the public domain, at least until 2067.\n\nThis study indicates that there is an active and hardy network of foreign and small domestic companies, associations, and individuals willing to make historic recordings available; indeed, some do this in spite of laws that force them underground or overseas.\n\nThese circumstances create a complex policy environment.

The subjects were educated about the new laws fighting digital piracy but it didn't have a significant affect in decreasing the intent to digitally pirate.\n\n* The authors also tried a religious treatment where they were told that the Islamic scholars denounced digital piracy. This was found to have a significant affect in decreasing the intent to pirate.\n\n* The largest significant effect was found in the awareness treatment where subjects were made aware of the negative impact of digital piracy and the future ramifications of it. When subjects were made aware of the negative impacrs of digital piracy their intention to pirate dropped (in a statistically significant fashion) the most compared to the other treatments.

      "abstract": "With rapid advances in networking and multimedia technologies, end-user digital piracy has caused more substantial impacts to firms producing digital contents as well as the society at large. In response to the phenomenon, three related research have been conducted. The first research proposes a contingency model to understand the decision making process of end-user digital piracy behavior. The model encompasses two distinct piracy behaviors, namely unauthorized copying and unauthorized sharing, and two distinct digital contents. namely software as well as movie and music. Empirical support of the proposed model is obtained by a large-scale online survey. While the first research mainly adopts a cognitive perspective, the second research considers affective factors involved in unauthorized sharing that is seldom studied in previous literature. The third research focuses on response distortion that has been troubling many empirical studies on digital piracy. I propose an innovative method for structural equation modeling using data obtained by Randomized Response Technique (RRT) that is often mistaken as only suitable for univariate analysis. The usefulness and feasibility of this new method are supported by large-scale empirical studies on software piracy.",

Modest support was found for neutralization theory when controlling for other theoretical variables. Modest support was also established for social learning theory.

      "abstract": "This paper looks at the largely unexplored terrain of how young people find music that is new to them in an environment with an unprecedented number of possibilities. Digital media has changed not only how artists create and distribute content, but also how listeners find and access new material. The new options exist in the context of older traditions such as using one\u2019s social networks or traditional media to find content. Based on original data with a sample of college students, we find that while students use digital media to find music new to them, social networks and traditional media continue to play a very important role in the course of exploration. We also find that digital technology is used differently by different types of music consumers and draw distinctions between peer-to-peer services and browsing, with the former more likely to be used by students from higher socio-economic backgrounds who are opinion leaders in the realm of music. We conclude with observations about the nature of opinion leadership and music and argue that future research should examine more closely the links among the discovery and sharing of culture, opinion leadership and social recognition and status.",

These objections typically involve playwrights\nobjecting to changes being made to their copyright works by other parties, such as directors and\nactors. This analysis is deepened by the use of two concepts from the field of art theory \u2013 \u2018aura\u2019,\nas put forward by Walter Benjamin, and \u2018trajectory\u2019, as outlined by Bruno Latour and Adam\nLowe. Finally, to shed further light on the issues raised, the work of Pierre Bourdieu is used to\npresent new empirical research recently undertaken by the author in the field of UK theatre. This\nresearch demonstrates that \u2018power struggles\u2019 are a common feature of theatrical collaboration; that\ncopyright is deeply implicated in the way such power struggles are conceived; and moreover, that\nresolving these power struggles successfully \u2013 including taking account of \u2018integrity-based objections\u2019\n\u2013 is crucial to theatrical practice.",

      "abstract": "The primary objective of this research is to identify the individual factors which influence the intention to pirate software and digital media in Thailand. An increasing of the speed of internet and the high technologies of digital compression are factors that made a digital piracy happen easily. Moreover, the lower cost of hi-speed internet is the incentive of the software and digital media piracy occurrences. This is only one of many reasons which cause digital piracy. As Thailand was ranked 13th in the most software piracy in the world in 2003, there are a lot of concerns about the high increasing of the digital piracy in Thailand. This study focuses on one of the digital piracy model, and uses The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a based theory to determine the factors influencing software and digital piracy. Attitude, Subjective norms and Perceived Behavioral Control are the factors described in TPB as they affect to the intention to create the behavior. Past Behavior is another factor added in this study apart from TPB, which has an impact to the piracy intention. The digital piracy behavior model was developed in this study, and the five hypotheses were proposed. A survey is used to collect data for testing the constructs of the research. Almost four hundred people in Thailand were asked to answer the questionnaire which was developed from an effective guideline to examine the constructs in TPB. Attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and past behavior were found significantly to be predictors of digital piracy intention. Moreover, the digital piracy intention was a greatest determinant of digital piracy behavior as described in TPB. The implication of this study is to identify the digital piracy factors which relate to people's behavior and to model the digital piracy behavior framework for better understanding of digital piracy behavior. In addition, using the result of this research, a better understanding of the cause of the piracy intention emerges. These can be used to help fighting with a software and digital media piracy in Thailand.",

Yet scholars have universally overlooked this rich source of data. This study fills that gap through a comprehensive empirical analysis of copyright infringement litigation, examining the pleadings, motions, and dockets from more than nine hundred copyright lawsuits filed from 2005 through 2008. The data we collect allow us to examine a wide variety of copyright issues, such as the rate of settlements versus judgments; the incidence of litigation between major media companies, small firms, and individuals; the kinds of industries and works involved in litigation; the nature of the alleged infringement; the success rates of particular parties and claims; and the nature of remedies sought and awarded. We also analyze the data to identify ways in which copyright litigation differs from other civil suits and to show that certain plaintiff characteristics are more predictive of success.",

      "abstract": "Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 establishes the affirmative defense to copyright infringement of \u201cfair use,\u201d by far the most enigmatic doctrine in U.S. copyright law and by far the most important. Without it, much of our economic and communicative action would constitute copyright infringement.   Yet despite the importance of the fair use defense, and despite the enormous amount of scholarly attention that it has received, we continue to lack any systematic, comprehensive account of our fair use case law and the actual state of our fair use doctrine. Instead, our conventional wisdom derives from a small set of conventionally agreed-upon leading cases. This Article presents the results of the first empirical study of our fair use case law to show that much of our conventional wisdom about that case law is mistaken. Working from a data set consisting of all reported federal opinions that made substantial use of the section 107 four-factor test for fair use through 2005, the Article shows which factors and subfactors actually drive the outcome of the fair use test in practice, how the fair use factors interact, how courts inflect certain individual factors, and the extent to which judges stampede the factor outcomes to conform to the overall test outcome. It also presents empirical evidence of the extent to which lower courts either deliberately ignored or were ignorant of fair use doctrine set forth in the leading cases, particularly those from the Supreme Court. Based on these descriptive findings, the Article prescribes a set of doctrinal practices that will improve courts\u2019 adjudication of the fair use defense.",

Given the objective of exploring moral logics, grounded theory seemed an appropriate choice. Results revealed that 21 respondents considered software piracy unethical whereas 17 did not. Though\neconomic reasons formed the most fundamental logic in both the cases, an overall analysis revealed that the respondents mostly used moral justification (neutralization) for not considering software piracy unethical whereas those considering it unethical used normative\n(principled) logics.

Whether these costs would be outweighed by the plan's benefits would be a productive starting point for future discussion.\n\n*In light of big data's growing economic and social importance, policymakers and the public should be concerned with how the legal system will influence the production and use of this valuable new resource.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze how stand-up comedians protect their jokes using a system of social norms. Intellectual property law has never protected comedians effectively against theft. Initially, jokes were virtually in the public domain, and comedians invested little in creating new ones. In the last half century, however, comedians have developed a system of IP norms. This system serves as a stand-in for formal law. It regulates issues such as authorship, ownership, transfer of rights, exceptions to informal ownership claims and the imposition of sanctions on norms violators. Under the norms system, the level of investment in original material has increased substantially. We detail these norms, which often diverge from copyright law's defaults. Our description is based on interviews with comedians, snippets of which we include throughout the paper. \n\nOur study has implications for intellectual property theory and policy. First, its suggests that the lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. Second, it suggests that the rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. Third, we suggest that comedians' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. Fourth, we note that stand-up's norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer. We suggest that the system's crude rights structure is driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. Lastly, social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law's one-size-fits-all mold. They do so, moreover, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying. \n\nStand-up's norms system has both benefits and costs, which we detail in the paper. However, norms-based IP systems offer an alternative (or supplementary) cost/benefit bundle which in some cases may be superior to that of formal law alone. In stand-up's case, norms economize on enforcement costs and appear to maintain a healthy level of incentives to create alongside a greater diversity in the kinds of humor produced. A final assessment of stand-up's social norms system awaits further work. With what we currently know, we are cautiously optimistic.",

      "abstract": "Copyright matters to creators. The claim has pervaded copyright jurisprudence and economic analysis for over 200 years. Creative production would not take place without the incentive of artificial scarcity that copyright law provides. Authors and artists would starve.\n\nProfessor Breyer (as he then was) wryly remarked in The Uneasy Case (1970, at 324): \u201cIt is, of course, conceivable that some prospective Miltons have given up writing after learning that Milton\u2019s daughter was destitute, but it is unlikely.\u201d\n\nThis article surveys what the empirical data actually say about the way creators live. The argument proceeds in three steps.\n\nFirst, the relationship of copyright and contract law is conceptualised, starting from an analysis of contracts concluded in a pre-copyright environment (Milton 1667; Schiller 1791). The extent of statutory dependence is then scrutinised for typical sources of earnings of creators at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nSecond, empirical evidence on creator earnings in developed cultural markets is reviewed. It is shown that the bottom 50% of composers/songwriters earn less than 5% of the total income of the population of composers/songwriters; the bottom 50% of literary authors earn under 10% of total income; the bottom 50% of visual creators earn about 10% of total income. Median incomes are close to the poverty line. The top 10% of creators receive a disproportionally large share (visual creators: 45% of total income; literary authors: 65% of total income; composers/songwriters: 80% of total income).\n\nFinally, possible interpretations of these data in the light of Landes & Posner\u2019s \u201charmony of interest\u201d assumption (An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, 1989) are considered and rejected. Creators (authors, performers) and investors (publishers, producers) have conflicting interests, and copyright law does not harmonise but exacerbate these.\n\nThe article concludes that copyright law empirically fails to secure the financial independence of creators. If it works as an incentive for some, this may be based on a systematic cognitive mistake.",

One between an author and the publisher and the other between a footballer and the club. The author goes on to make the point that contracts between the author and publisher would exist even without copyright citing the contract between the footballer and the club as an example of that type of contract.\n* Takes a closer look into the utilitarian rationale of copyright, and suggests a shorter term copyright. \n* Secondly the author move on to contrast income of different types of creators with copyright contracts (using data from various different surveys and data sources) with income from all UK employees. The author found that the income from copyright industries was significantly less on average and far more unequal compared to income from all employment and that most artists gained large amounts of income from non-copyright sources like teaching. The author also added that artists\u2019 income was very unstable and more creators try to embark on a career than are able to sustain them.\n* Strong competition for author and lower consumer prices was suggested as a solution to motivate creators.\n* Large number of artists make their money from non-copyright works\n* Author highlights the large gap between what the top creators, in both visual and literary markets, earn compared to the rest, continues to conclude that copyright makes this gap between distributions worse. \n* Lastly the author critiqued the \u201charmony of interest assumption\u201d outlined by Landes and Posner in 1989. The author concluded that for superstar creators the market works well, they can either choose to shift risk to commercial intermediary and the publisher can also choose to share risk through a royalty contract or absorb it using a buyout. This however is not true with non-bestselling creators as they have less market power and face large amounts of competition. This conflicts with the \u201charmony of interests assumption\u201d and also empirical evidence in the paper contradict the idea that copyright provides financial independence for creators partly also due to superstar affect.",

      "abstract": "Over the last twenty years, arguments for broader copyright have taken an increasingly mercantilist turn. Rather than argue for broader copyright in terms of more or better original works, proponents have begun arguing for broader copyright on the basis of revenue and jobs. Consumer copying is theft or piracy, proponents insist, depriving copyright owners of revenue and destroying jobs. In this article, I review these arguments and show that they are empty. While the Internet and digital technology has made widespread consumer copying a reality, broader copyright can be justified only if this copying has interfered with the creation and dissemination of new original works. But it has not. Using a hand-coded data set examining the number of new artists and cover songs in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the first week of each month for the years 1990-2010, I show that while music industry revenue has fallen sharply since Napster opened its virtual doors, output in the music industry, both in terms of quantity and quality, has increased just as sharply. Part of the explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result, is that the digital revolution, while it has made consumer copying trivially easily, has also reduced costs, risks, and barriers to entry in the music industry. Yet, this cannot be a complete explanation.\n\nTo account for the rest, I offer a theoretical model and a simple explanation for why the incentives for music creation have remained sufficient in the face of widespread consumer copying: Consumers don\u2019t just love music generally; they love their particular favorite artists and their specific favorite songs. While consumers would like to get music for free, they know that they have to support their favorite artists in order to get and to continue getting the music they want. As a result, self-interest tends to ensure that consumers do not free ride too much. While the resulting market is unlikely to be perfect, legislation from Congress is not likely to improve the situation. Just as product markets fail in predictable circumstances, so too do political markets. When, as in the debate over broader copyright, proposed legislation benefits a concentrated interest group, such as copyright owners, at the expense of a dispersed interest group, such as copyright consumers, Congress is systematically likely to get the answer of how much copyright is optimal wrong, and badly wrong at that. In short, we have far more to fear from government intervention in the markets for original works than we do from leaving these markets alone.",

      "abstract": "Modern copyright law is based upon a theory: increase copyright protection and you increase the number of creative works available to society. This theory has been the driving force behind an economic vision that has expanded, beyond all recognition, the original law created by the Statute of Anne. And with this expansion, we are told that the costs associated with copyright are worthwhile because of the bounty it produces. What if this theory could be tested? After all, this is not a question of faith or morality, nor is it a statement on how humans should behave; it is a theory about how humans do behave. In this article, we use statistical analysis to test the theory that increasing copyright protection usually increases the number of new creative works. Relying upon U.S. copyright registrations from 1870 through 2006 as a proxy for the number of works created, we considered how four variables, population, the economy, law changes, and technology influenced subsequent copyright registrations. Based upon this data, our findings cast serious doubt on the idea that with copyright law, one size fits all. While individual law changes may be associated with changes in subsequent copyright registrations, overall, the relationship between law changes and registrations is neither consistent nor completely predictable.",

      "abstract": "Over the last twenty years, arguments for broader copyright have taken an increasingly mercantilist turn. Rather than argue for broader copyright in terms of more or better original works, proponents have begun arguing for broader copyright on the basis of revenue and jobs. Consumer copying is theft or piracy, proponents insist, depriving copyright owners of revenue and destroying jobs. In this article, I review these arguments and show that they are empty. While the Internet and digital technology has made widespread consumer copying a reality, broader copyright can be justified only if this copying has interfered with the creation and dissemination of new original works. But it has not. Using a hand-coded data set examining the number of new artists and cover songs in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the first week of each month for the years 1990-2010, I show that while music industry revenue has fallen sharply since Napster opened its virtual doors, output in the music industry, both in terms of quantity and quality, has increased just as sharply. Part of the explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result, is that the digital revolution, while it has made consumer copying trivially easily, has also reduced costs, risks, and barriers to entry in the music industry. Yet, this cannot be a complete explanation.\n\nTo account for the rest, I offer a theoretical model and a simple explanation for why the incentives for music creation have remained sufficient in the face of widespread consumer copying: Consumers don\u2019t just love music generally; they love their particular favorite artists and their specific favorite songs. While consumers would like to get music for free, they know that they have to support their favorite artists in order to get and to continue getting the music they want. As a result, self-interest tends to ensure that consumers do not free ride too much. While the resulting market is unlikely to be perfect, legislation from Congress is not likely to improve the situation. Just as product markets fail in predictable circumstances, so too do political markets. When, as in the debate over broader copyright, proposed legislation benefits a concentrated interest group, such as copyright owners, at the expense of a dispersed interest group, such as copyright consumers, Congress is systematically likely to get the answer of how much copyright is optimal wrong, and badly wrong at that. In short, we have far more to fear from government intervention in the markets for original works than we do from leaving these markets alone.",

The more covers existed the worse the quality of songs ,at that specific time period, were seen to be.\n\n* The hypothesis was that if napster caused a decrease in quality of music then  there should be more covers in the top 100 and fewer new artists.\n\n* The author compared pre and post napster charts and found that there was a steady decrease in the amount of covers after napster and that there was little change in new songs on the list, in fact if anything a slight increase after napster. Thu concluding that after napster the quality of songs has actually increasedand the number of new artists has stayed more or less the same.\n\n* The author continues with a discussion about SOPA and PIPA which outlines the rationale for them and goes on to argue the rationale is not optimal for welfare. \nThe paper found that in the music industry consumer copying has led to falling revenue, and perhaps reduced employment, for particular copyright industries.

      "abstract": "Many criticize fair use doctrine as hopelessly unpredictable and indeterminate. Yet in several recent empirical studies, leading scholars have found some order in fair use case law where others have seen only chaos. Building upon these studies and new empirical research, this Article examines fair use case law through the lens of the doctrine's chronological development and concludes that in fundamental ways fair use is a different doctrine today than it was ten or twenty years ago. Specifically, the Article traces the rise to prominence of the transformative use paradigm, as adopted by the Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, over the market-centered paradigm of Harper &amp; Row v. The Nation and its progeny. The Article presents data showing that since 2005 the transformative use paradigm has come overwhelmingly to dominate fair use doctrine, bringing to fruition a shift towards the transformative use doctrine that began a decade earlier. The Article also finds a dramatic increase in defendant win rates on fair use that correlates with the courts embrace of the transformative use doctrine. In' light of these developments, adding an historical dimension to a study of fair, use case law helps to make sense of what might otherwise appear to be a disconnected series of ad hoc, case-by-case judgments and explains why current rulings might seem to contradict those regarding like cases issued when the market-centered paradigm still reigned supreme.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, the problem of orphan works \u2014 i.e., copyrighted works whose owners cannot be located by a reasonably diligent search \u2014 has come sharply into focus as libraries, archives, and other large repositories of copyrighted works have sought to digitize and make available their collections online. Although this problem is certainly not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do not make their collections available at all.\n\nIn October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined with the Copyright Office\u2019s remedy limitation approach, are better approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than alternatives proposed elsewhere. Finally, we explore future-looking changes, such as the reintroduction of copyright formalities and the development of registries, that would reduce the number of orphan works in the future.",

      "abstract": "At various dates between 1991-2002, nineteen OECD countries extended the duration of copyright, typically from the author\u2019s life plus 50 years to author\u2019s life plus 70 years. We study the impact of the extensions on the production of movies. \nWe find that the extensions were associated with an increase in movie production ranging between 8.51% (\u00b14.60%) and 10.4% (\u00b14.89%). The increase was higher in countries where piracy was lower. \n\nThese findings were robust to various specifications, including concomitant changes in government funding of movie production. \n\nThe extension of copyright duration applied retrospectively to owners of existing film libraries and might have reduced their cost of capital. However, studios with larger libraries did not increase movie production relatively more than smaller studios. \n\nOur results suggest that contrary to received thinking among leading economists and lawyers, extensions of copyright duration far in the future did have economically significant effects on the production of movies.",

Based  on  longitudinal  qualitative  research, it  argues  that  a  radical  shift  has \noccurred in the professional values that television producers\u2019  associate with their creative work, by  focusing  on  ethical  and  professional  norms  within  factual  television  production.  By considering  the  historical  and  contemporary discourse  of  \u2018craft\u2019  within  this  area  of  creative work,  the  article  interrogates  the  nature  of  the  changes  that  have  taken  place.  The  wider significance  of  these  changes  is  also  considered,  through  an  engagement  with  theoretical concerns about the place of craft within late modernity (Sennett 2006), and with debates about the  changes  that  have  taken  place  within  the  political  economy  of  independent  television production.  The  article\u2019s  findings  have  contextual  significance  within  contemporary  debates about creative work (Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2010). Despite the celebratory policy rhetoric of the  \u2018creative  industries\u2019  (DCMS  1998),  the  transformed  production  environment  within contemporary British television has had a detrimental effect on skills retention an development, as well as on the potential for creativity within the industry.",

Others insist instead that without an owner to control their use, valuable public domain works will be overexploited or otherwise debased. This study of the most valuable musical compositions from 1913-32 demonstrates that neither hypothesis is true as it applies to the exploitation of songs in movies from 1968-2007. When compositions fall into the public domain, they are more likely to be exploited in movies, suggesting no under-exploitation.

      "abstract": "Intellectual property scholars have begun to explore the curious dynamics of IP's negative spaces, areas in which IP law offers scant protection for innovators, but where innovation nevertheless seems to thrive. Such negative spaces pose a puzzle for the traditional theory of IP, which holds that IP law is necessary to create incentives for innovation. \n\nThis paper presents a study of one such negative space which has so far garnered some curiosity but little sustained attention - the world of performing magicians. This paper argues that idiosyncratic dynamics among magicians make traditional copyright, patent, and trade secret law ill-suited to protecting magicians' most valuable intellectual property. Yet, the paper further argues that the magic community has developed its own set of unique IP norms which effectively operate in law's absence. The paper details the structure of these informal norms that protect the creation, dissemination, and performance of magic tricks. The paper also discusses broader implications for IP theory, suggesting that a norm-based approach may offer a promising explanation for the puzzling persistence of some of IP's negative spaces.",

Against this backdrop, calls for new (broader) exceptions have been made; but suggestions that in fact fewer (narrower) exceptions are needed have been made as well. Copyright commentators, stakeholders with opposing interests, policy makers and academics have sometimes taken partial and diametrically opposing views in the debate.\n* Absent clearly identified and persistent market inefficiencies, exceptions are not likely to be warranted from an economic perspective.\n* Policy-makers should take a cautious approach when considering introducing new exceptions for such reasons: the market power of rightholders is limited by the inherent limitations in the scope (and length) of copyright protection and the availability of substitute creative work; and positive externalities may easily be exaggerated. Furthermore, with technological advances rightholders may increasingly be able to efficiently offer different, inferior versions of copyrighted work, obviating the rationale for the users to \u201cself-produce\u201d them. This means that the social loss due to market power, externalities, or productive inefficiencies, may not be as large as to justify the social costs of exceptions.\n* Social costs of exceptions predominantly manifest themselves in the form of reduced incentives for creative work and in the form of reduced incentives of the rightholders and distributors to provide access to existing and new work efficiently. Moreover, exceptions may stall the development of future efficient markets which technological advances may soon enable. Clearly, besides the potential benefits, the policy maker will have to consider the likelihood and the economic significance of these costs in the assessment of new exceptions.",

Some existing exceptions, like the citation exception, seem to be at least in part motivated by such considerations.  \n*In the view of technological advances, which allow for new modes of exploitation of creative works, calls for new exceptions have been made. Besides enabling new modes of exploitation and use of creative work, technological advances may also result in a reduction in transaction costs.\n*Assuming that markets for creative works exist but that the rightholders possess market power \u2013 which may result in a deadweight loss and which could potentially be curbed by broader exceptions \u2013 it cannot be at present established on the basis of the economic theory alone whether exceptions should be narrowed or broadened in response to a reduction of the cost of making copies of creative works (brought about by technological advances). Furthermore, it cannot be established at present on the basis of theory alone whether exceptions should be broadened or narrowed down as a consequence of the expansion of the consumption possibilities of creative material (again brought about by technological advances). Nevertheless, there may be a case for exceptions in particular when they allow for the development of product qualities that a copyright owner could not produce herself due to transaction costs and technological constraints. Exceptions are also more likely justified in circumstances where hold-up problem risks introducing dynamic inefficiencies (in terms of suppressing incentives to invest).\n*Externalities potentially introduce a case for exceptions.  The implementation of certain exceptions meant to solve problems due to transaction costs or externalities may run into difficulty when the dissemination and efficient access to the work requires some effort on the part of the right\u2019s owner. It is then worth asking whether some market mechanism, or an alternative intervention cannot overcome the problems associated with externalities.",

Action is now required at EU level because revenue achieved with online content services in the US in 2004 was almost eight times higher than online content revenue produced in Western Europe. As music pervades European culture and society, only music has the real potential to kick-start online content services.\nThis Study examines the present structures for cross-border collective management of copyright for the provision of online music services. It concludes that the absence of EU-wide copyright licences for online content services makes it difficult for these music services to take off. Improving cross-border licensing for music services requires the creation of entirely new structures for cross-border collective management of copyright.\nIn order to improve cross-border management of copyright, this Study considers three options: (1) Do nothing (Option 1); (2) Suggest ways in which cross-border cooperation between national collecting societies in the 25 Member States can be improved (Option 2); or (3) Give right-holders the choice to authorise a collecting society of their choice to manage their works across the entire EU (Option 3).",

Their members produce the work that is at the heart of the information technology society, and vital to the future of the economy. However, increasingly concentrated corporations which control the media industries confront individual creators with ever more economically and socially unfair and abusive practices.\nThe CRA is particularly concerned that the interests and rights of its freelance members (who include authors, playwrights, journalists, directors, photographers, composers, songwriters and musicians) are being trampled upon throughout the media sector.\nThese abuses are perpetrated not only by the traditional pirates and counterfeiters but also, more significantly, by legitimate businesses: publishers, broadcasting companies, Internet Service Providers, data banks and the like who are undermining the work and livelihoods of the very people who are creators of all the content they wish to exploit.\nNot only are these problems economic, but fundamental rights of free expression are also under threat. Unlike the majority of their European counterparts, UK freelance creators are frequently coerced into waiving their moral rights, often irrevocably, to grant unlimited rights to publishers and broadcasters to edit, copy, alter, add to, take from, adapt or translate their contributions.\nIn commissioning this report, the CRA aims to highlight practices which are not only detrimental to the future of the UK\u2019s economy but are presently devaluing and demoralizing the vast majority of creators and thus discouraging ingenuity, originality and innovation throughout the media.",

These were the key questions that we set out to investigate with the support of a Beyond Text grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council and with the help of our network members where together we formed an interdisciplinary team comprised of experts in copyright law, cultural policy, cultural economics, dance and musical composition. Through a series of interviews with musicians, singers, songwriters, composers, dancers, choreographers and others involved in the music industry and dance community we came to the conclusion that these types of works are both before copyright and beyond copyright. They are before copyright because what matters to the majority of those involved is the process of creation \u2013 which itself is constantly evolving \u2013 rather than the product \u2013 the protected work once fixed. They are beyond copyright because key aspects of the performance involve contributions which are not recognised by copyright, and because there is much about the performance which simply cannot be captured in the mechanical sense. As a result, policy intervention, which focuses on the product rather than the process, becomes problematic. This article suggests a series of practical recommendations made by our interviewees for ways in which the art forms may be supported into the future.",

Thus, the case for an extension would have to be especially compelling to make it preferable to keeping term at its current length.

      "proposition": "* Benefits consist of welfare from new works created because of higher levels of expected revenue under the longer term. Costs consist of the increased deadweight losses stemming from restricted access to existing and future work due to the extension.\n\n* Investment in current artists should be based upon the prospects of profits, not the availability of past ones. Therefore retrospective term increases will have no effect upon the creation of new work.\n\n* Extension will increase the net present value of revenues for new works by 1% or less. While some authors argue that this small increase might, in some circumstances, result in a disproportionate reaction, nothing in the empirical evidence suggests that this is the case as regards current levels of production in the record industry.\n\n* Given the small size of this increase, the large number of works already being produced and the likely size of the deadweight loss (particularly in relation to historical works) it is our view that a term extension will likely result in a net loss to UK society as a whole.\n\n* Increasing copyright term increases revenues to the record industry. For retrospective extensions the 2% increase in the present value of revenues (being approximately 160 million pounds) suggested by PwC would seem plausible while for prospective extensions the figure would likely be 1% or lower. \n\n* Existing literature gives little indication as to how revenues would be distributed however our research did indicate that featured recording artists would likely benefit to some extent from such an extension with typical royalties rates around 5\u201315%.\n\n* Existing economic theory plausibly suggests that the extension of copyright term increases costs to consumers (consumers should be construed in a wide sense to include all users of recorded music including bars, film-makers, broadcasters etc). While the immediate cost of prospective extension is likely to be small, the immediate cost of an extension applied to existing works would likely be significant.\n\n* Increasing copyright term in the UK from 50 to 70 (or 95 years) is likely to have a significant, negative effect, on balance of trade.\n\n* The theoretical arguments that some incentive is required to induce publication, archiving and preservation activities in relation to old works seem to us to be plausible. However the review does not find that the need for such incentives would justify giving existing copyright holders an extended term of protection in the original work.\n\n* Modern systems of law regard the protection of established rights as fundamental. That is, once granted, modern legal systems rarely reduce existing entitlements. The effect of the principle of respect for established rights is that it is much easier to extend copyright term than to reduce it (so much so that term extensions are likely to be 'irreversible'). \n\n* If term were not extended and research over the next ten years showed this lack of extension to have been a mistake then it would be relatively easy to correct this error by introducing a term extension.",

      "abstract": "Downloading digital products for free may harm creators and intermediaries because consumers may no longer buy the version for sale. However, as we show in this paper, this negative effect may be overcompensated by a positive effect due to sampling: consumers are willing to pay more because the match between product characteristics and buyers\u2019 tastes is improved. This indeed holds under sufficient taste heterogeneity and product diversity.\nWe present a simple multi-product monopoly model in which products are located on the Salop circle and in which consumers regard each original as superior to its copy. We first consider a model with unit demand and full participation so that any increase in revenues stems from higher prices. The property that sampling allows consumers to find a better match to their tastes, tends to lead to higher profits under file-sharing. However, there is a countervailing effect: consumers have the option to download and listen to music without paying for it. In other words, consumers have the option to simply keep the download but not to buy the song or album. This tends to make not buying a more attractive option and tends to reduce the willingness-to-pay for music. We show that the former effect dominates the latter and that the introduction of file-sharing technologies leads to higher profits if there is\nsufficient taste heterogeneity and sufficient product diversity. We then extend the model to allow for variable demand and show that file-sharing can lead to lower prices, higher unit\nsales and higher profits",

      "abstract": "\"I don\u2019t think the record company loses one cent on a bootleg. If they go after bootleggers, they\u2019re wasting their money.\" (Max, a bootlegger, in Vettel, 1986)\n\nEach year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) releases a figure indicating the global value of pirated music. In 2000, this figure was $4.2 billion (IFPI, 2001). The IFPI argues that the actual losses suffered by the industry are not fully represented by this figure: \u2018The value of the pirate market does not indicate losses in revenue to the legitimate recording industry, which are likely to be far greater\u2019 (2001). These figures are then used in a strenuous lobbying campaign for the creation and enforcement of tougher copyright laws demanding, for example, restrictions on private copying exemptions, deterrent penalties and the dismantling of compulsory licensing provisions. This lobbying campaign is only likely to intensify in the future in response to online copying and the proliferation of CD burners. The IFPI, and its American equivalent, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) are skilful and powerful lobbyists, and past evidence suggests that policy-makers will continue to be influenced by their arguments.\n\nThe effects of piracy are, however, more difficult to ascertain. This is for three reasons. First, the word \u2018piracy\u2019 is a blanket term covering a wide variety of activities, including counterfeiting, pirating, bootlegging, home taping, tape trading and online file sharing. All of these areas of piracy have individual characteristics that make any attempt at synthesis a hazardous and, some might say, misleading venture. Second, the world of illegal recordings is not the easiest from which to gather data. As Jeremy Phillips writes: \"Unfortunately, counterfeiters do not yet have to file annual returns to the Commission on the scale of their illegal activity, which means that the figures put forward for losses caused by counterfeiting are in danger of being subjective, hypothetical and methodologically flawed. (1999: 275)\"\n\nPiracy figures are often used for their rhetorical impact rather than as a reflection of reality. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, recording industry statistics do not take into account the variety of different meanings and uses that pirated music takes in the day-to-day lives of many people. Music plays an important role in the creation of meaning in many people\u2019s lives, and the industry\u2019s concern with questions of supply (who owns these recordings?) has neglected important questions of demand (why do people want them?) (Frith, 2002). This results in a distorted impression of the effects of piracy. For example, music industry representatives lobbying for a levy on blank audio tape in the early 1980s (and again for blank digital audio tape later in the decade) argued that every blank tape sold resulted in one less official sale (Frith, 1987: 59). The small amount of non-industry sponsored research conducted into the area, however, indicates that people often use blank tapes in non-displacing activities (for example, Brown et al., 2001; Cohen, 1990).\n\nThis article looks at one area of piracy \u2013 bootlegging \u2013 and discusses its possible effects upon the official industry. It begins by briefly differentiating bootlegging from other forms of piracy, and then provides an overview of the scale of bootlegging and the type of music fans who buy bootlegs. Following this, it discusses the possible effects of bootlegging upon the official industry. Bootlegging is a highly idiosyncratic area of piracy and the discussions here cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spheres. However, the overall purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further research into the meanings of music piracy across a wide variety of settings in order to obtain a more realistic impression of the scale and effects of piracy in the music industry.",

A very successful bootleg would then go to a second pressing of another 500 copies, but this is rare. Anything in the region of 3,000 sales would be considered enormous in bootlegging circles.\n\n*Given that a release by a major label has to sell around 300,000 copies just to break even, the greatest successes of the bootleggers would still rank among the most dismal of failures for the mainstream industry.\n\n*The people who buy bootlegs are extremely committed fans who use bootlegs as a way of maintaining an ongoing, meaningful relationship with their favoured artists or bands. \n\n*The recording industry argues that bootlegs detract from officially released record sales: but the collector\u2019s interest in the unofficial recordings of an artist generally stems from an extensive knowledge of their official canon, and thus the majority of bootleg buyers will own all the official releases of their artist(s) before even beginning to buy bootlegs. \n\n*This loyalty has often been exploited by the record labels: through box sets, unreleased recordings, multiple great hits and singles collections etc. \n\n*The recording industry argues that recording artists and songwriters do not obtain any royalty payments from the sale of a bootleg: the majority of bootlegs are of live performances and these tend to involve someone smuggling a recording device into the venue and recording the show. If this is so, then the artist (and his record label) has received payment for that performance in the shape of ticket sales (not including the revenue generated from sales of concert souvenirs such as T-shirts).

However, a very important aspect of the value chain has\nbeen largely ignored-the fact that between creation and consumption, many contracts are likely to be involved, and copyright will, logically, have effects upon the way those contracts are written and interpreted. It is interesting that economists themselves have not put the issue of contracts into the forefront of the economics of copyright, since certainly the study of contracts and the incentives that they create is of primordial interest to economists generally.\n\nThis Article reviews the scant economics literature that does deal with the relationships between the legal institution of copyright and the contracts that are then written along the value chain. It is to be emphasised that this Article only deals with the economic theory literature, and does not consider the legal literature.

In this manner, the real significance of Areopagitica in the history of copyright law lies in the way in which the work was misinterpreted and re-branded as an essay expounding the author's natural proprietary rights.\n\n*The use of Milton and his work to substantiate claims about the natural proprietary rights of the author, while carrying considerable rhetorical weight, may not accurately reflect Milton's attitudes and thoughts upon the same. \n\n*To draw upon Milton to warn against the dangers of allowing any individual to determine, on the grounds of their religious or political conviction, whether another's work should be published or not, is arguably a more fitting and appropriate use of the poet's opinions and his work.",

      "abstract": "The impact of copying, in the form of file-sharing, has become a stormy policy issue. Previous copying technologies have mostly failed to live up to the extravagant predictions of harm that arose with those new technologies although precise measurements of copying's impact was rarely accomplished or attempted. One impediment to measuring the impact of copying with prior technologies was the difficulty of measuring copying activity. File-sharing is the newest technology for making copies and carries with it the possibility of more precise measurement of copying than has been possible in the past. This paper examines the measurement of file-sharing activity, the theory of file-sharing's likely impact, and the impact of file-sharing. Analysis of various data sets indicate that they do not yet live up to their hoped for precision. Data limitations not withstanding, the evidence seems compelling that file-sharing is responsible for the recent large decline in CD sales for which it has been blamed.",

      "abstract": "A formal definition of cultural industries is developed following four distinct features of cultural goods: (a) oversupply, (b) quality uncertainty, (c) network effects and (d) demand reversal. Drawing on economic and socio-psychological notions of \u2018network\u2019, increasing returns and social contagion effects are distinguished. Increasing returns may govern the adoption of standards when choices are binary, social contagion explains the diffusion of cultural goods when choices are multiple. Together, the four structural features delineating cultural industries account for curious competitive dynamics prevalent in cultural markets, such as the notorious 10 : 90 proportionality (under which 10% of cultural goods account for 90% of the market), causal ambiguity about the reasons for success, and the formation of fashions. Six managerial recommendations are advanced, focusing on a criticial circulation point triggering self-sustaining diffusion patterns. Finally \u2018project-based enterprises\u2019 and \u2018network forms of governance\u2019 are identified as the organizational forms most suited to the dynamics of the cultural markets.",

      "abstract": "At the center of the file-sharing debate is the empirical issue of whether or not file-sharing decreases sales. I should note that file-sharing can have a strong negative impact on sales even when a majority of downloads do not replace a sale. I am unaware of any serious analyst who has ever claimed a 1:1 relationship between an unauthorized copy and a lost sale, whether we are talking about photocopying or whether we are examining file-sharing. There are several estimates that the number of music files exchanged on file-sharing networks is larger than the number purchased through legitimate channels. If so, file-sharing could cause a ma jor loss of sales even if only a relatively small percentage. of unauthorized downloads translated into a lost sale. Nevertheless, estimates of the number of music\nfiles downloaded in file-sharing networks vary widely. In this paper I examine the different empirical methodologies that have been chosen in attempts to shed some light on this issue. These studies generally take different approaches in terms of their data analysis. The studies consistently find that file-sharing has led to a serious decline in record sales, except for one highly publicized study that reaches very different, and in my opinion, highly implausible conclusions.",

Collectivist nations place a greater emphasis on social harmony than confrontation, on shame than guilt, and on face than truth. The relationship of individualism to software piracy suggests that anti-piracy campaigns need to demonstrate that piracy is a shameful practice that brings a loss of face upon the family, school or business firm. A focus on the criminal nature of piracy would probably have less impact. Economic solutions should provide incentives so that the whole group, rather than the individual, is willing to comply with legal norms. In addition, the software industry needs to understand that collectivist countries, such as India, place less emphasis on individual rights as opposed to overall social well being. For the software business to convince governments of collectivist countries, it must demonstrate that strict regulation of software piracy would lead to greater overall well being for society.",

Conjoint analysis and a random coefficient discrete choice model using Bayesian approach with Gibbs sampling are used to estimate the preferences. Based on the quantitative results, we use simulation to look at how a new pricing strategy and the threat of legal penalty for file sharing would influence the online music market. Findings include these: estimated willingness to pay for downloading one music file is significantly less than the actual price of the file; consumers are sensitive to longer search and download times for music files and very sensitive to the threat of legal action; and consumers are not sensitive to online music services broadening their catalogues. Finally, the simulation shows that a combination of increased transaction costs for illegal file sharing and lower-priced digital music files would inhibit illegal file sharing and bolster the number of people purchasing music legally from the online services.",

      "abstract": "Cinema attendances in the United Kingdom and the United States have been subject to severe declines in the post-war period. Fairly strong evidence (Belson, 1958) exists that the arrival and development of television contributed powerfully to the initial decline. As\ntelevisions now populate almost every home we would expect this influence to have worked itself out. The 1980's have seen the arrival of videos as a new threat to cinema takings. Analysts of the industry have been suggesting (Docherty et. al., 1986), (Variety, 1985) that the threat is more apparent than real with demographic factors and/or poor films being the cause of more recent audience declines. These claims derive from casual inspection of ticket receipts (Variety, 1985) or one-off surveys of consumer attitudes (Docherty et. al., 1986). To date there has been no concrete evidence offered for or against the impact of video. Such evidence is hard to gather because of data limitations. This is particularly the case for the U.S. where there is the added complication of\ndiffusion of pay TV. The U.K. is free from this complication as pay TV is still extremely rare and monthly price and attendance figures are available until their publication ceased in May 1985. In this note we use a demand equation to discuss what ticket sales would have been in the period (January 1983 onwards) when video access began to gather impetus. Comparison of the equation results with actual ticket sales suggests a marked reduction which may tentatively be attributed to the VCR.",

Obviously, this will reduce the demand and shrink the market for pirated software.\n\n*The results show a negative and statistically significant relationship between Corruption Perception Index and the piracy rate. \n\n*The results suggest that greater civil liberty suppresses the incentive for software piracy.\n\n*Countries such as USA and Australia, which have better record of civil liberties, experience a very low piracy rate as compared to very high software piracy in countries like China where civil liberty is often violated. \n\n*Inclusion of economic freedom indicates that economically free economies experience a low piracy rate.

A general argument on the private benefits that could accrue from engaging in the creation of public goods in the form of a \u201cprivate-collective\u201d model of innovation incentives is mentioned. \n\n*New research explores how motives produce a mix of outcomes, and how various motives interact to produce contributions to open source software projects. There are new insights on how firm participation, community participation, and technical design relate to the contributors\u2019 motivations. \n\nResearch on Governance, Organization, and the Process of Innovation:\n\n*Researchers have shown interest in the challenge of governing open source software projects. Projects are based on contributions by many and sometimes thousands of volunteer developers. Volunteers can be divided into two groups: people who expect to receive rewards from contributing\nto open source software (investors), and people who do not (donators). Open source software projects may have succeeded at creating a new governance structure that reconciles the interests of people in both groups. \n\n*An emerging body of research has provided detailed accounts of open source software project organizations, highlighting a pronounced difference in roles taken by contributors.\n\n*New research shows innovation processes in open source software significantly deviate from predictions made by existing innovation theory. Case Studies and conceptual frameworks for understanding the unique character of, and the requirements for, innovation processes in open source software have been undertaken and developed.\n\nResearch on Competitive Dynamics: The Impact of Free:\n\n*Past research investigated how new technologies such as open source software can compete in an environment dominated by commercial technological standards, and a model for the impact of open source (copyleft) licensing on both the developer environment and the market for software was developed. This shows that although both commercial and open source software can coexist, scarcity of labour and product pricing must be taken into account. \n\n*Researchers also studied software firms that used open source software in delivering customized products. A framework of increasing resource allocation to open source software development showed that increased \u201cpublic\u201d investment can lead to great \u201cprivate\u201d benefits for open source\u2013oriented firms.\n\n*New research focuses on understanding competitive dynamics. Researchers consider the mixed duopolies in which competing firms and others have heterogeneous objective functions; the technology platforms mediating competition in many industries and collaboration between firms and the open source software movement.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, we have witnessed a historical shift in the enforcement of copyright law. While copyright enforcement against private copying traditionally centered on commercial intermediaries and piracy, content owners now also pursue infringement actions against consumers and private copiers directly. While consumers of pirated content have traditionally been captured indirectly through taxes or blanket licenses, they are now subjected to a mass litigation campaign.\nDespite the wide media attention and spectacular headlines, litigation has produced only limited results in the present era of digital downloading and peer-to-peer (or \"P2P\") file swapping. Lawsuits against private copiers have not halted file-sharing activities. An ever-increasing number of unlicensed downloads are taking place in private homes all over the world. According to recent data, over twelve million people' are simultaneously sharing 1.08 billion music, movie, and software files on the Internet at any given moment.\nWhy are individuals unresponsive to the increased costs of downloading unlicensed music? One possible reason is that individuals simply believe that the chances of being caught are too remote because there are so many people downloading at any given moment in time. Downloading fell temporarily during the initial wave of lawsuits but increased again during subsequent rounds of lawsuits as file swappers updated their estimation of the chances of getting caught.\nNotwithstanding the limited deterrent effect of lawsuits on file sharing, record industry representatives, who often refer to lawsuits in terms of \"educating\" the public on copyright law, have announced that they will continue to pursue litigation against individual file swappers. In this Article, we suggest that if litigation\nindeed serves purposes other than deterrence, legal sanctions are unlikely to alter the social meaning and legitimacy of peer-to-peer networks and file sharing. Because of a convinced belief among copyright users that file sharing should be legal, copyright enforcement is challenged by a social norm complication. Drawing\non socio-psychological literature and new data from an empirical study, we posit that copyright litigation faces an impossibility theorem: lawsuits against file sharers cannot simultaneously achieve effective deterrence and promote pro-copyright norms.",

These options, including criminal prosecutions of digital piracy, copyright education, self-help strategies, and collective licensing, are evaluated in light of the interaction of deterrence and anticopyright norms. The authors argue that social norm backlash is particularly relevant for copyright law because circumvention technology and the so-called technological \"arms race\" between content holders and pirates inevitably create lapses in copyright enforcement.

Experienced users of peer-to-peer technology have internalized an anticopyright norm that cannot be unraveled through enforcement. Anticopyright norms of file swapppers are strengthened when the level of copyright\nenforcement increases, which results in more downloading whenever enforcement is temporarily suspended. Enforcement has an ambivalent effect on individuals who have no experience with file sharing. Severe sanctions do not have a counterproductive effect on copyright norms of such \"non-file sharers,\" yet exposure to information on copyright enforcement against peer-to-peer software reinforces the belief or expectation that others are downloading.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we propose that \u201cnorms-based\u201d intellectual property systems exist today, and are an important complement to or substitute for law-based intellectual property systems. Norms-based IP systems, as we define them, operate entirely upon the basis of implicit social norms that are held in common by members of a given community. Within that community, they offer functionality \u201csimilar to\u201d contemporary law-based IP systems with respect to both the nature of rights protected and the effectiveness of protection provided.\n\nWe document the existence of a norms-based IP system among a sample of accomplished French chefs. These chefs consider recipes they develop to be a very valuable form of intellectual property. At the same time, recipes are not a form of innovation that is effectively covered by law-based intellectual property systems. Via grounded research, we identify three strong implicit social norms related to the protection of recipe IP. Via quantitative research, we find that accomplished chefs enforce these norms, and apply them in ways that enhance their private economic returns from their recipe-related IP.\n\nIn our discussion, we compare the attributes of norms-based and law-based IP systems, arguing that each has different advantages and drawbacks. We also point out that the existence of norms-based IP systems means that many \u201cinformation commons\u201d may prove to be criss-crossed by norms-based fences, with community access controlled by community IP owners.",

Three had no stars but were listed in the Michelin guide as chefs de cuisine in \u201cgood gastronomic restaurants.\u201d\n\n*In the second phase, questionnaires were sent to chefs who had been recognized in the Michelin guide.

The first three built the case for three propositions concerning costs, copyright, and DRM, while this article explores the question of what economic incentives will suffice to facilitate an effective market in the absence of intellectual-property or copy protection. It bases its analysis, in part, on empirical evidence collected from interviews with musicians and music consumers.\n\nThe article first defines the problem: explaining why the old business models have eroded in the face of new technologies and of the changing role of the law \u2014 especially copyright law. Then, it builds on the author\u2019s work in his New Architectures article, explaining who makes music, who consumes it, and why. These sections explain that while money plays a role in the marketplace for music, it is secondary to \u201chedonic\u201d factors both for musicians, who make music largely for self-expressive and self-affirmation reasons, and for consumers, who listen to music for reasons including idiosyncratic perceptions of its quality, a desire to be part of a particular crowd, and vicarious identification with or attraction to the performers.\n\nThis Article then explores the essential role that intermediaries play in the marketplace. This section acknowledges that the new kinds of intermediation needed in the new technology-driven market place will not occur unless intermediaries can make money. Building on this foundation, this Article develops the elements of a business model that can sustain new forms of intermediation.",

      "abstract": "A well-functioning copyright law must provide robust support for authors, who are, after\nall, the first beneficiaries of the copyright system. Indeed, U.S. copyright law derives\nfundamentally from the principle that authors\u2019 interests are inseparable from the broader public interest. While \u201c[t]he immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an \u2018author\u2019s\u2019 creative labor,\u201d the \u201cultimate aim is . . . to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\u201d Accordingly, to the extent that the current copyright system is not working effectively for authors \u2013 or is disfavoring a discrete class of authors \u2013 Congress should be concerned.\n\nIn the framework of the resale royalty discussions, the authors at issue are certain visual\nartists, including painters, illustrators, sculptors, and photographers (hereinafter \u201cvisual artists\u201d or \u201cartists\u201d). Based on the information and comments provided during the preparation of this report, as well as the Office\u2019s independent research, the Office agrees that, under the current legal system, visual artists are uniquely limited in their ability to fully benefit from the success of their works over time. The distinctive nature of the creation and marketing of visual art has not changed since the Office\u2019s main study on the topic, published in 1992. At the same time, recent developments \u2013 including in particular the adoption of resale royalty laws by more than thirty additional countries since the Office\u2019s prior report \u2013 would seem to warrant renewed consideration of the issue.\n\nIn general, visual artists do not share in the long-term financial success of their works.\nInstead, the financial gains from the resale of their works inure primarily to third parties such as auction houses, collectors, and art galleries. Moreover, the income typically available to other authors through reproduction and derivative uses of their works is more limited for artists. Although the Internet has provided artists with greater opportunities to exploit derivative images and/or sell mass-produced copies of their works, stakeholders agree that \u201cfor most visual artists . . . the amounts involved in reproduction or representation are generally insignificant.\u201d Indeed, it appears to be common ground that reproduction rights represent a \u201cvery minor aspect of [most artists\u2019] careers\u201d and that the first sale of a work is \u201cthe main or exclusive source of income for almost all American artists.\u201d\n\nThe Copyright Office agrees that these factors place many visual artists at a material\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis other authors, and therefore the Office supports congressional\nconsideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite,8 which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party. A large and growing number of countries around the world \u2013 more than seventy in total \u2013 now follow that approach. Other potential responses might include the facilitation of voluntary initiatives among stakeholders in the art market, amending the copyright law to give artists a continuing economic interest in their works through, for example, greater interests in public display or commercial rental rights, and increased federal grants for visual art programs. \n\nThat said, an \u201cinformation problem\u201d in the art market \u2013 something that many have acknowledged \u2013 does present certain challenges. Any assessment of the treatment of visual artists under U.S. law suffers from a lack of independently verifiable data about the operation of the art market and a resulting difficulty in determining whether a resale royalty in particular would truly operate to place artists on equal footing with other authors. At the same time, the Office recognizes that many of the arguments against the right are overblown. Moreover, according to the most recent studies, a number of the adverse consequences that this Office\u2019s previous report predicted might follow from implementation of the right have not materialized in countries that have adopted droit de suite since that time. Accordingly, the Office finds no clear impediment to implementation of a resale royalty right in the United States and supports the right as one alternative to address the disparity in treatment of artists under the copyright law.",

There are sound policy reasons to address this inequity,\nincluding the constitutionally-rooted objective to incentivize the creation and\ndissemination of artistic works.\n\n\u2022 While a resale royalty could be one of many factors affecting the location of auctions and other art sales, there is no evidence to conclusively establish that it would harm the U.S.visual art market.

The Office\u2019s 1992 report highlighted the\nfact that resale royalties appear to benefit only an extremely small number of artists.\nCurrent studies and reports remain consistent with this view.

      "abstract": "As provided in the Constitution, the rights granted to authors are not merely to be articulated, but also \u201csecur[ed].\" Unfortunately, and perhaps ironically, as the rate of infringement has increased, so too have the barriers to pursuing copyright claims in the federal courts. These barriers are largely practical: federal litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and therefore out of reach for many copyright owners. The problem is especially vexing in the context of small claims, where the injury may be limited or difficult to measure. If exclusive rights are unenforceable, they are weakened as the pillars of the copyright law, and public respect for our nation\u2019s creativity is eroded in turn. The problem of modest-sized copyright claims, on the one hand, and costly enforcement, on the other, appears to be especially acute for individual creators. \n\nIn comments submitted to the Copyright Office in the course of this study, the Graphic Artists Guild wrote that \u201c[a]s a practical matter, except for large corporate copyright owners, our current copyright laws are virtually unenforceable when it comes to the infringement of visual works.\u201d In a similar vein, American Photographic Artists explained that \u201cthe current system deters authors from asserting their rights, renders these cases difficult for any attorney to take on, and encourages copyright infringement by all phases of society.\u201d The Alliance for Visual Artists pointed out that \u201c[t]he traditional method of protecting copyrights \u2026 is simply impracticable for a small business photographer with limited income.\u201d Observing that \u201c[w]e weaken markets for valuable goods at our collective peril,\u201d the Authors Guild reported that a majority of authors surveyed saw the need forthat while \u201c[s]uch small claims and random infringements may seem unimportant, \u2026 taken in the aggregate, they have an effect on the livelihoods of individual creators akin to the infamous torture \u2018death by a thousand cuts.\u2019\u201d \n\nCreators are not alone in voicing these concerns. Citing the \u201chindrances that currently exist in preventing copyright owners from pursuing copyright claims of relatively small economic value,\u201d the American Bar Association\u2019s Section of Intellectual Property Law offered recommendations in support of \u201ca much needed avenue for small copyright claims adjudication.\u201d Organizations that provide pro bono assistance to lower-income artists, such as California Lawyers for the Arts and the New York-based Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, emphasized what they saw as a pressing need for alternatives to federal litigation. \n\nFinally, the frustrations of those seeking to defend against claims of infringement \u2013 who\nthemselves may be smaller actors and who also face high litigation costs \u2013 cannot be overlooked. The Copyright Office trusts that the findings and recommendations of this Report will be helpful to Congress as it continues to explore the issue of small copyright claims.",

The tribunal would be staffed by three\nadjudicators, two of whom would have significant experience in copyright law \u2013 together\nhaving represented or presided over the interests of both owners and users of copyrighted\nworks \u2013 with the third to have a background in alternative dispute resolution.\n\n\u2022 The tribunal would be a voluntary alternative to federal court. Its focus would be on\nsmall infringement cases valued at no more than $30,000 in damages. Copyright owners\nwould be required to have registered their works or filed an application before bringing\nan action. They would be eligible to recover either actual or statutory damages up to the\n$30,000 cap, but statutory damages would be limited to $15,000 per work (or $7,500 for\na work not registered by the normally applicable deadline for statutory damages).\n\n\u2022 Claimants who initiated a proceeding would provide notice of the claim to responding\nparties, who would need to agree to the process, either through an opt-out mechanism or\nby affirmative written consent. Respondents would be permitted to assert all relevant\ndefenses, including fair use, as well as limited counterclaims arising from the infringing\nconduct at issue. Certain DMCA-related matters relating to takedown notices, including\nclaims of misrepresentation, could also be considered, and parties threatened with an\ninfringement action could seek a declaration of noninfringement.\n\n\u2022 Parties would provide written submissions and hearings would be conducted through\ntelecommunications facilities. Proceedings would be streamlined, with limited discovery\nand no formal motion practice. A responding party\u2019s agreement to cease infringing\nactivity could be considered by the tribunal and reflected in its determination. The\ntribunal would retain the discretion to dismiss without prejudice any claim that it did not\nbelieve could fairly be adjudicated through the small claims process.\n\n\u2022 Determinations of the small claims tribunal would be binding only with respect to the\nparties and claims at issue and would have no precedential effect. They would be subject\nto limited administrative review for error and could be challenged in federal district court\nfor fraud, misconduct, or other improprieties. Final determinations could be filed in\nfederal court, if necessary, to ensure their enforceability.",

Secondly, this approach is applied to a specific topic, the change in copyright law in the form of the introduction of a new property right for performers in the UK that has come about as a result of the harmonisation programme of the European Union. Finally, new data were collected to assess the likely impact this change in law would have on performers' earnings using the music industry as a case study.

      "abstract": "For many citizens, Intellectual Property (IP) is an obscure and distant domain \u2013 its laws shrouded in jargon and technical mystery, its applications relevant only to a specialist audience. And yet IP is everywhere. Even a simple coffee jar relies on a range of IP rights \u2013 from patents to copyright, designs to trade marks.\n\nIn the modern world, knowledge capital, more than physical capital, drives the UK economy. Against the backdrop of the increasing importance of ideas, IP rights, which protect their value, are more vital than ever. The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nThe Government\u2019s decision to commission this Review was an explicit recognition both of the growing importance of IP and of the challenges brought by the changing economic environment. In commissioning the Review, the Chancellor and the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, and Culture, Media and Sport asked me to establish whether the system was fit for purpose in an era of globalisation, digitisation and increasing economic specialisation.\n\nThe answer is a qualified \u2018yes\u2019. I do not think the system is in need of radical overhaul. However, taking a holistic view of the system, I believe there is scope for reform to serve better the interests of consumers and industry alike. There are three areas in which the Review concentrates its recommendations to improve the UK framework for innovation:\n\n\u2022 strengthening enforcement of IP rights, whether through clamping down on piracy or trade in\ncounterfeit goods;\n\u2022 reducing costs of registering and litigating IP rights for businesses large and small; and\n\u2022 improving the balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use\ncontent in ways consistent with the digital age.\n\nMuch IP policy is framed by European, and indeed global, treaties and agreements. I recognise that not all the recommendations are within the direct purview of the UK Government. However, I have not shied away from making recommendations with European or broader international import when they seemed necessary. Indeed, with the European Commission currently reviewing both the copyright acquis and the question of a Community patent, this is a timely point at which to put forward the Review\u2019s arguments. \n\nI would like to express my thanks to all those who assisted me in producing this Review. Many individuals and organisations gave generously of their time to contribute insights, and in particular the great diversity and depth of responses to the Call for Evidence were invaluable. I owe a special debt to the Review team, who have supported me throughout: Richard Sargeant, Steve Coles, Alastair Cowie, Suzy Kantor, Nicola Kay, Stephen Rowan and Nathan Sansom.\n\nI hope this Review provides sound recommendations on how the IP regime should respond to the challenges that it faces. Getting the balance right is vital to driving innovation, securing investment and stimulating competition. Lasting success will belong to those who get this right.",

There should be no accompanying levies for consumers.\n\n* Allow private copying for research to cover all forms of content. This relates to the copying, not the distribution, of media.\n\n* Amend s.42 of the CDPA by 2008 to permit libraries to copy the master copy of all classes of work in permanent collection for archival purposes and to allow further copies to be made from the archived copy to mitigate against subsequent wear and tear.\n\n* Enable libraries to format shift archival copies by 2008 to ensure records do not become obsolete.\n\n* Propose that Directive 2001/29/EC be amended to allow for an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the parameters of the Berne Three Step Test.\n\n* Create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008. \n\n* Propose a provision for orphan works to the European Commission, amending Directive 2001/29/EC.\n\n* The Patent Office should issue clear guidance on the parameters of a \u2018reasonable search\u2019 for orphan works, in consultation with rights holders, collecting societies, rights owners and archives, when an orphan works exception comes into being.\n\n* The Patent Office should establish a voluntary register of copyright; either on its own, or through partnerships with database holders, by 2008.\n\n* Match penalties for online and physical copyright infringement by amending section 107 of the CDPA by 2008.\n\n* Monitor success of current measures to combat unfair competition in cases relating to IP, and if changes are found to be ineffective, Government should consult on appropriate changes.\n\n* DCA should review the issues raised in its forthcoming consultation paper on damages and seek further evidence to ensure that an effective and dissuasive system of damages exists for civil IP cases and that it is operating effectively. It should bring forward any proposals for change by the end of 2007.\n\n* Observe the industry agreement of protocols for sharing data between ISPs and rights holders to remove and disbar users engaged in \u2018piracy\u2019. If this has not proved operationally successful by the end of 2007, Government should consider whether to legislate.\n\n* The Home Office should recognise IP crime as an area for Police action as a component of organised crime within the updated National Community Safety Plan.\n\n* Give Trading Standards the power to enforce copyright infringement by enacting section 107A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 by 2007.\n\n* Strengthen Practice Directions, to provide greater encouragement for parties to mediate, in particular this should raise the profile of mediation with judges.\n\n* The Patent Office should consult with the Judicial Studies Board to determine the extent to which the complexity of IP law may give rise to a training need for judges and magistrates and their legal advisers.\n\n* Support the establishment of a single EU court to adjudicate cross-border IP disputes by promoting the European Patent Litigation Agreement. \n\n* Establish a new Strategic Advisory Board for IP policy (SABIP), covering the full range of IP rights, reporting to the minister responsible, by 2007. The Board should be drawn from a wide range of external experts as well as key senior policy officials from relevant government departments, and should be based in London. \u00a3150,000 should be allocated to fund the secretariat by the Patent Office.\n\n* The Patent Office should provide an annual IP strategic analysis fund of \u00a3500,000 managed by the policy advisory board in consultation with the IP Policy Directorate.\n\n* Patent Office should introduce a clear split of responsibility between delivery and policy directorates.\n\n* Encourage IP policy officials to obtain policy experience outside the IP Policy Branch, and support short industry placement schemes for policy staff.\n\n*Realign UK Patent Office administrative fees to cover costs more closely on Patent Office administrative operations (e.g. granting patents).",

      "abstract": "Of the 188 member countries, 156 of them have at least one statutory library exception, and most of the countries have multiple statutory provisions addressing a variety of library issues. Thus, of the 188 countries, 32 have no library exception in their domestic copyright statutes. These basic statistics suggest strongly that exceptions for libraries and archives are fundamental to the structure of copyright law throughout the world, and that the exceptions play an important role in facilitating library services and serving the social objectives of copyright law. The most common subject matter of the statutes is making copies (usually single copies) of works for readers, researchers, and other library users, and making copies for preservation of materials in the collections. Almost as frequently, countries have enacted statutes authorizing libraries to make copies for replacement of works that have suffered damage or loss.\n\nThese three topics long have been a mainstay of library exceptions, but recent years have brought revisions that reflect changing needs and new technologies. Most significantly, the European Union adopted a 2001 directive that authorized member countries to make digitized copies of works available to users on the premises of the library for research and study. That provision has been adopted in many of the European countries, and analogous statutes have been made a part of domestic law in countries beyond the E.U. On the other hand, relatively few countries have enacted truly distinctive law that breaks from various trends in lawmaking to address newly emerging problem areas at the border between copyright and digital technologies. Among the countries that have enacted extensive and original statutes in recent years are Canada, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile few countries have enacted comparable major changes, at any given time many countries are either revising their library exceptions or adopting entirely new copyright acts. Indeed, Mauritius and Seychelles adopted wholly new copyright acts in 2014. Revisions of selected copyright statutes have occurred during just the last several months in numerous European countries and in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore. Research on worldwide copyright developments is a dynamic pursuit.",

      "abstract": "Protection of the public domain comprises two steps, as laid down by the Development Agenda: first, identifying the contours of the public domain, thereby helping to assess its value and realm, and, second, considering and promoting the conservation and\naccessibility of the public domain.\n\nThe present study will follow the same direction as it will first assess the scope of the\npublic domain, as defined by copyright laws, history and philosophy, before turning to the\nissue of its effectiveness and greater availability to the public and society at large. This will lead to the formulation of some recommendations that, by viewing the public domain as material that should receive some positive status and protection, might help to support a robust public domain, as advocated by the Development Agenda.\n\nOur purpose is not to define what should be or not be in the public domain, nor to look\nat the causes of the shrinking of the public domain, or only incidentally. This study is\nsituated beyond the debate as to what should be copyrighted or not, to what extent and for how long. It will not deal with the question of determination of those limitations to intellectual property (as to the scope of the rights, the object of the protection, the adequate duration of the right, etc.). Such delineation is fundamentally a matter for policy that has to be decided by States, both at an international and national level.\nAs a consequence, the public domain that will be sketched here is not only what is left\nafter the contours of copyright have been drawn, but is a repository of resources of its own.\n\nAccordingly, the recommendations formulated at the end of this study will not focus on the\nscope of copyright and the way to curb it, but will rather try to develop strategies to make the public domain itself flourish and be made more available to the public. This study will also be limited to the public domain as resulting from copyright legal regimes and not by patent or trademark.\n\nPart I of this study will give an evaluation of the role of the public domain in copyright,\nstarting by a definition of what public domain is and what it should be distinguished from.\nThe public domain in the history and justification of copyright will also be provided.\nPart II will identify the components of the public domain, notably based on an\nillustrative comparison of national legislation. It will also analyse other legislatively granted rights and/or interests that may modify and interfere with the level of accessibility and usability of the copyright-related public domain. Part III will provide a survey of non-legislative and private ordering initiatives, which provide for greater access, use, identification and location of the public domain and other creative material whose conditions of use are akin thereto. Part IV will sketch a possible future for the public domain, by developing the impetus it is gaining in legislative and judicial contexts, the key principles that could govern it for a more positive status, and finally by formulating recommendations in regard to future activities on the public domain in relation to copyright that may be carried out by the World Intellectual Property Organization.",

Further research could certainly be carried out on that point.\n\no An exception or attenuation of the lex loci protectionis could be envisaged so as to\nmutually recognize the validity of a dedication to the public domain when valid in the\ncountry of origin of the work.\n\no The issue of orphan works should be dealt with at the international level or at least, a\nmutual recognition of the status of the orphan work applied in one country should be\nrecognized by other Parties to the Berne Convention (except when identification or location of the author can be solved in this other country). WIPO should also help to set up networks of information about works in order to facilitate the identification of authors of orphan works. This would clarify the protected or unprotected status of orphan works.\n\no International endeavours should be devoted to developing technical or informational\ntools to identify the contents of the public domain, particularly as far as the duration of\ncopyright is concerned. Such tools can be data collections on works, databases of public domain works, or public domain calculators. International cross-operation and cross-referencing of such tools is of particular importance.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties could be modified to integrate, in the definition of \u201cRights\nManagement Information\u201d, any electronic information pertaining to public domain works.\n\n- As far as the availability and sustainability of the public domain is concerned:\no The availability of the public domain should be enhanced, notably through cooperation\nwith cultural heritage institutions and UNESCO (through its work on the preservation of\nintangible cultural heritage).\n\no Legal deposit should be encouraged at national level, which might involve some\nfinancial and logistical help for developing countries. At international level, catalogues\nand cross-referencing of deposited works should be set up.\n\no The role of cultural heritage institutions, and mainly libraries, in the labelling,\ncataloguing, preserving and making available of public domain works, should be\nrecognised and supported, particularly in the digital environment.\n\no Research should be carried out to identify means to promote the divulgation and\nexploitation of public domain material in terms of funding and incentives. The research\ncould include the tool of the domaine public payant, as means to make commercial\nusers of public domain works contribute, through a minimal sum, to the collecting and\nmaintaining of public domain material carried out by public institutions. Where the moral\nright is perpetual, there should be ways of controlling possible abuses in exercising the\ndivulgation or integrity right.\n\no Any extension of the scope or duration of copyright and related rights, both at\ninternational and national level, should take into account the empirical effects on the\nsustainability of the public domain.\n\n- As far as the non-exclusivity and non-rivalry of the public domain is concerned:\no Legal means should be found to prevent the recapture of exclusivity in works that have\nfallen into the public domain, whether through another intellectual property right\n(trademark or right in databases), property rights, other legal entitlements or technical\nprotection, if such exclusivity is similar in scope or effect to that of copyright or is\ndetrimental to non-rivalrous or concurrent uses of the public domain work.\n\no The 1996 WIPO Treaties should be amended to prohibit a technical impediment to\nreproduce, publicly communicate or making available a work that has fallen into the\npublic domain. There is no legal basis for the enforcement of technical protection\nmeasures applied to the public domain, as public domain status should guarantee the\nright to make re-use, modification, reproduction and communication. It could also be\nclarified that only technological measures protecting copyrighted works that form a\nsubstantial part of the digital content to which they apply will be protected against\ncircumvention. Technological measures mainly protecting public domain works, with an\nancillary and minimal presence of copyrighted works, should not enjoy legal protection.\n\no As Berne countries are required to respect within their territory the intellectual property\nprotection granted by other countries, they should recognize the public domain status\ndefined by other countries and prevent privatization of what is in the public domain\nelsewhere.",

I examine the effects of U.S. copyright piracy during a period when the U.S. was itself a developing country. U.S. statutes since 1790 protected the copyrights of American citizens, but until 1891 deemed the works of foreign citizens to be in the public domain. In 1891, the laws were changed to allow foreigners to obtain copyright protection in the United States if certain conditions were met. Thus, this episode in American history provides us with a convenient way of investigating the consequences of international copyright piracy. My analysis is based on copyright registrations, information on authors, book titles and prices, financial data from the accounts of a major publishing company, and lawsuits regarding copyright questions. These data are used to investigate the welfare effects of widespread infringement of foreign works on American publishers, writers, and the public. The results suggest that the United States benefited from piracy and that the choice of copyright regime was endogenous to the level of economic development.",

      "abstract": "When the Prime Minister commissioned this review in November 2010, he did so in terms which some considered provocative. The Review was needed, the PM said, because of the risk that the current intellectual property framework might not be sufficiently well designed to promote innovation and growth in the UK economy.\n\nIn the five months we have had to compile the Review, we have sought never to lose sight of David Cameron\u2019s \u201cexam question\u201d. Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators\u2019 rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth?\n\nThe short answer is: yes. We have found that the UK\u2019s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that we must put our hugely important creative industries at risk. Indeed, these businesses too need change, in the form of more open, contestable and effective global markets in digital content and a setting in which enforcement of copyright becomes effective once more.\n\nThe Review sets out how this can be achieved. We have focused upon the main issues, at the risk of ignoring important points of detail, and have tried to set out a clear, strategic argument, supported with just ten recommendations. We are also making available online a number of documents which explore the available evidence and submissions made to the Review. If the Review\u2019s recommendations are followed, the result will be more innovation and more economic growth.\n\nOur intellectual property framework will face further significant pressure to adapt in the coming years, as we make our way into the third decade of the commercial internet. We urge Government to ensure that in future, policy on Intellectual Property issues is constructed on the basis of evidence, rather than weight of lobbying, and to ensure that the institutions upon which we depend to deliver intellectual property policy have clear mandates and adaptive capability. Without that, the pile of IP reviews on the Government\u2019s doorstep \u2013 four in the last six years \u2013 will continue to accumulate.",

This elicited submissions from individuals (including creators, representatives and academics) to those made by corporate stakeholders (collecting societies, public sector organisation and trade bodies among others). In addition to the call for evidence the review conducted a number of meetings and engagement events with stakeholders both in the UK and the USA.\n\nThe secondary source data is largely drawn from two distinct types of source: previous policy reports (e.g. Commission on\nIntellectual Property Rights (2002), Gowers (2006), previous academic research and industry data (e.g. annual statements, industry generated research).\n\nIn general the review finds significant obstacles to constructing a comprehensive evidence base for IP policy. \n\n\"There are three main practical obstacles to using evidence on the economic impacts of IP:\n\n\u2022 There are areas of IPRs on which data is simply difficult to assemble. While patents are well documented, and traceable to their owners, unregistered design rights and copyright use are not.\n\u2022 The most controversial policy questions usually arise in areas (such as computer programs, digital communication and biosciences) which are new and inherently uncertain because they involve new technologies or new markets whose characteristics are not well understood or measured.\n\u2022 Much of the data needed to develop empirical evidence on copyright and designs is privately held.

      "intervention_response": "This review (widely referred to as Hargreaves Review) makes 10 distinct policy recommendations. A number of these a concerned largely with issues surrounding patent law. However, the majority are relevant to copyright policy.\n\n1. Evidence: Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights.\n\n2. International priorities: The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the Patent Cooperation Treaty a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications.\n\n3. Copyright licensing:\n\u2022 In order to boost UK firms\u2019 access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice.\n\u2022 The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. Collecting societies should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets.\n\n4. Orphan works: The Government should legislate to enable licensing of orphan works. This should establish extended collective licensing for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange.\n\n5. Limits to copyright: Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including format shifting, parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and data analytics. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract.\n\n6. Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation: In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should:\n\u2022 take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending \u201cwork sharing\u201d with patent offices in other countries;\n\u2022 work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit;\n\u2022 investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of patent thickets, including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets.\n\n7. The design industry: The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs.\n\n8. Enforcement of IP rights: The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the DEA becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court.\n\n9. Small firm access to IP advice: The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice.\n\n10. An IP system responsive to change: The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UK\u2019s IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government.",

      "abstract": "The advent of file sharing has considerably weakened effective copyright protection. Today, more than 60% of Internet traffic consists of consumers sharing music, movies, books, and games. Yet, despite the popularity of the new technology, file sharing has not undermined the incentives of authors to produce new works. We argue that the effect of file sharing has been muted for three reasons. (1) The cannibalization of sales that is due to file sharing is more modest than many observers assume. Empirical work suggests that in music, no more than 20% of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing. (2) File sharing increases the demand for complements to protected works, raising, for instance, the demand for concerts and concert prices. The sale of more expensive complements has added to artists\u2019 incomes. (3) In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers.

The sale of more expensive complements has added to artists\u2019 incomes. \n\n3: In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative.

      "abstract": "In the European Union, the protection of copyright and related rights is territorial in the sense that these rights are provided by national laws and their geographical scope is limited to the territory of the state granting them. As a result, enforcement of rights occurs\non a country-by-country-basis. With respect to online on-demand uses of their creative works, authors of music and audiovisual works as well as holders of related rights enjoy an exclusive right of making their works available online to the public \u201cin such a way that members of the public can access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them\u201d. In practice, online on-demand services also often involve a relevant act of reproduction of copyright protected works which entails the clearance of a second type of right, namely the reproduction right.\n\nSome stakeholders have suggested that the current copyright regime makes the clearance of rights for cross-border online uses an unnecessarily complex as well as resource-consuming process. Multinational service providers indeed often have to negotiate required rights separately for several territories since licensing content on a territory-by-territory basis (territorial licensing) appears to be a common practice in Europe. This arguably raises barriers to cross-border online access and prevents the online sphere from realising the full economic potential associated with the borderless nature of the internet.\n\nIn this report, we take territorial licensing as consisting of rightholders exercising the territorial nature of copyright by limiting the geographical scope of the rights granted to  licensee to a proper subset of EU Member States within a particular transaction. In line with this definition, the territorial nature of copyright is in itself not a sufficient condition for territorial licensing to take place. Indeed, the decisions of licensors to restrict the geographical scope of licences (i.e. to license on a territory-by-territory basis), are based on private motivations and depend on the wider institutional context, not only on the territorial nature of copyright. This report analyses the private motivations underlying the choice of territorial licensing in the current institutional framework in order, in a nutshell, to answer the following question: would a limitation to the practice of territorial licensing improve social welfare? The report focuses on two kinds of copyright-protected works, recorded music and audiovisual works.",

      "proposition": "* The study identifies several key mechanisms through which the proposed scenarios are likely to affect total welfare. These mechanisms can be broadly categorised into three groups: (1) the use of vertical agreements to affect the interaction between parties within the vertical supply chain and between vertical supply chains, (2) price discrimination and (3) transaction costs.\n\n* Territorial licensing, as an instance of vertical agreements, could generate efficiencies by allowing the parties in vertical relationships to control for harmful externalities. However, it could also be used anti-competitively. The scope for efficiencies would appear to be significant in the relevant industries, and potential harmful effects, while possible, do not appear to be systemic. Therefore, policy changes which reduce the effectiveness of territorial licensing entail a risk of undermining the associated efficiencies which do not appear to be justified by the possibility to reduce the risk of harm.\n\n* Regarding price discrimination, our analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to static welfare that might flow from the proposed policy changes. However, we also find that, in scenarios which limit the ability to restrict territorial scope of licences, dynamic effects would likely negatively affect total social welfare. Our analysis suggests that, due to the importance of sunk costs in both the music and the audiovisual industries and due to the short life of these products, the weight put on preserving the dynamic incentives to invest in the production of creative content should be significant. Price discrimination in the audiovisual and music industries might then well be efficient overall. \n\n* It may indeed well be that the increase in transaction costs which results from territorial fragmentation of rights is an unavoidable side-effect of efficient licensing practices. A careful examination of the determinants of transaction cost reveals, perhaps counterintuitively, that some of the analysed policy changes designed to promote multi-territorial exploitation of content might result in an increase in transaction costs in comparison to the Status Quo. This is because in some of the scenarios legal and/or business uncertainty would likely increase.\n\n* The analysis of the four hypothetical scenarios favours the introduction of the country of origin principle while preserving the freedom of contracting (Scenario 2). This scenario could indeed reduce transaction costs while preserving the ability of the stakeholders to limit the territorial scope of their licences through appropriate contractual clauses. However, such conclusion is subject to a few important caveats.",

      "abstract": "Like so many facets of the modern world, television has been transformed by the application of digital technologies and the parallel and related development of the fast evolving Internet. While some broadcasters \u2013 especially those in developing economies - still utilise traditional analogue transmission techniques, most have transitioned to more efficient and powerful digital means of sending their programming to viewers. Use of digital technologies has enabled explosive growth in the number of channels and choices of programmes offered. It has also ceded more control to the viewer, allowing on-demand access to programming \u2013 not only from broadcasters and pay TV service providers, but also increasingly from online video services delivered over the open Internet. Indeed, as this report outlines, the definitional boundaries between broadcasting and other forms of digital video delivery are increasingly blurred. \n\nThe viewer is undoubtedly a winner as a result of these developments as we move ever closer to the ultimate provision of ubiquitous choice, convenience and control. And broadcasters are usually winners too as evidenced by the impressive global TV market growth described in this report. Inevitably, that growth and technological development is not evenly distributed geographically, and we outline some of the key regional trends in the pages that follow, as well as some more focused snapshots of the market evolution within selected countries.\n\nHowever, this report also highlights a paradox at the heart of this technological revolution; namely, that the ceding of ever more control to the viewer also inevitably means an increasing risk that broadcasters lose control of their programming. It becomes harder and harder to prevent unauthorised access to the copyrighted content that traverses the globe at lightning speeds as digital \u2018bits\u2019. This poses an ever greater threat to the economics of intellectual property that sustain the broadcast and related industries.",

However, while the online TV sector has been growing since 2009, traditional pay TV still accounts for the majority of TV revenues. Television has remained similarly resilient in the advertising market, where it maintains the highest share of advertising revenue across all media. \n\n* Online video is currently growing complementarily to TV advertising, but some cannibalization is starting to be observed in the European Nordic region. Television and video delivery platforms are becoming increasingly complex as viewing preferences move towards a world in which content is available on-demand and in a device agnostic manner. The move to digital from analogue delivery methods has been a key trend among traditional television platforms, since digitisation offers less constraint on the number of channels available to viewers. \n\n* The development of the internet has also seen the growth of online video platforms, which has given rise to changing behaviours of viewers around the world, as well as new competitors to traditional TV players. \n\n* Mobile video consumption is growing rapidly, driven by the growth in smartphone adoption and advanced 4G mobile data networks. However, direct monetisation of mobile video is challenging, with users opting for free services or video delivered as part of a wider premium pay TV or online video subscription, for which there is no additional fee for mobile access.\n\n* The digitisation of all content has unified delivery platforms, meaning that future technologies a more fluent interchange between different platforms. For example, a satellite TV image can interface with internet content delivered over mobile. This places pressure on video distribution to move towards higher quality video. The cost of this has two aspects: the availability of a network or spectrum to deliver, and the technologies needed to improve the efficiency of delivery over a given network.\n\n* For broadcasters, a drawback of the increasing prevalence of digital technologies and changing viewing behaviour is that the ease of obtaining unauthorised access to copyrighted content has increased. As a result of this, various types of piracy have arisen, which bring with them the risk of broadcasters losing control of their programming, as well as threatening the economics of intellectual property.

We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior in a scientific data-driven manner by using extensive traces from Akamai\u2019s streaming network that include 23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers, who watched an aggregate of 216 million minutes of 102 thousand videos over 10 days.

      "abstract": "The legal protection of rights to sporting events (\u201dsports organisers' rights\u201d) is a contentious issue. While in recent years distinct aspects of the problem have been addressed by legislatures and courts, both at the national and at the European level, a great deal of legal uncertainty persists. Divergent views on the appropriateness, form and scope of such legal protection exist among stakeholders and other concerned parties, reflecting the complex nature and multiple functions of sports in modern society. The universe of sports and media is a complex network of social and commercial relationships with a variety of stakeholders, each one of whom can claim rights or specific interests in the value chain of organizing and exploiting sports events, such as clubs, leagues, athletes, federations, fans, media content providers, sponsors, owners of sport facilities, sports betting operators and news media.  \n\nConsequently, the question of protecting sports events is by no means a one-dimensional legal issue, and should be framed in a broader socio-economic context. On the one hand, professional sport represents a large and fast-growing sector of the European economy \u2013 and in no small measure this is due to the commercial significance of sports media rights. On the other hand, sports are widely regarded as playing a pivotal role as a \u201csocial cohesive\u201d, an agent of communal, and conveyor of moral, values. This helps explain why major sports events qualify in various Member States as \u201cevents of major importance\u201d for society, subject to special media rules mitigating exclusive rights of broadcasters to guarantee viewers\u2019 access to these events via free-to-air television.  \n\nThe general objective of this study is to examine and critically assess a number of the most pressing questions of substantive law relating to the existence and exercise of sports organisers' rights in the EU. The specific objectives of the study are:  \n\uf0b7 To map the legal framework applicable to the origin and ownership of sports organisers' rights in the 28 Member States; \uf0b7 To analyse the nature and scope of sports organisers' rights with regard to licensing practices in the field of the media, taking into account relevant EU law provisions; \uf0b7 To examine the possibility of establishing licensing practices beyond the media field, notably in the area of gambling and betting; \uf0b7 To provide recommendations on the opportunity of EU action to address any problem that may be identified in the above mentioned areas of analysis.",

      "proposition": "* The rights and interests of sports organisers are generally well safeguarded at the substantive legal level. The \u201chouse right\u201d gives sports events organisers and clubs (and indirectly the sports federations) a right to exclude unauthorized media from the venue, and thereby creates leverage for the event organisers to negotiate exclusive contracts regarding media coverage. In practice, these contracts may or may not provide for complete or partial transfer(s) to the sports organisers of the copyrights and neighbouring rights in the audiovisual recording and transmission of the event. Sports events organisers or their federations may, alternatively, elect to produce and distribute media coverage of the sports events themselves. Either way, the combination of house right, media contract(s), and intellectual property protection of the audiovisual recording and broadcast effectively allows the sports event organisers to enjoy complete ownership and/or control over the audiovisual rights in the sports events.   \n\n* The integrity and financial benefits of a right to consent to bets can only be fully achieved when it is carefully managed by a national regulatory authority that:  \n1. actively prosecutes illegal betting services (including the offering of sports bets by licensed operators without the sports organisers\u2019 consent); 2. monitors the commercial exploitation of the right to consent to bets to prevent discriminatory or anti-competitive marketing conditions; 3. provides for an ex post mechanism for complaint handling and dispute resolution; 4. has the power to conduct on-going monitoring of the parties\u2019 compliance with the mutual rights and obligations contained in the contractual agreements. \n\n* The right of short news reporting is an important element of the EU legal order safeguarding the right of broadcasters to have access to \u201cevents of high interest to the public\u201d, such as important sports events, which are subject to exclusive broadcasting rights. However, the way this right is currently framed, allowing Member States the option of either mandating access to the transmitting broadcaster\u2019s signals, or requiring direct access to the venue where the event takes place, has resulted in some differences in implementation by the Member States (i.e. on the duration of the short news reporting).   \n\n* The comparative analysis of EU and national decisional practice reveals that for the most part the NCAs have replicated the heavy-handed remedy package designed by the European Commission. The \u201cno single buyer\u201d obligation, a remedy that was exceptionally imposed by the Commission in FAPL, is increasingly being emulated at the national level. Only with regard to the duration of exclusivity, more and more NCAs are demonstrating a readiness for a more flexible approach (i.e. by accepting exclusive rights contracts exceeding three years).",

      "abstract": "Research overview \n\nBackground and objectives \n\nIn early 2012 Ofcom commissioned research designed to track consumers\u2019 behaviour and attitudes towards both lawful and unlawful access of copyright material using the internet, relating to six content types; music, films, TV programmes, computer software, books and video games. The primary objective of this research was to gather data and generate insight by establishing initial benchmarks and trends that could be used to assist policy making related to online copyright enforcement. This followed the adoption by Government of a recommendation made in the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth that Ofcom should not wait until its progress-reporting duties under the Digital Economy Act came into force to begin gathering trends and benchmarks related to consumption of content online.\n\nThe research universe for this study was all adults aged 12+ in the UK. The survey used a mixed methodology approach whereby data was collected using both an online and offline sample. All material relating to the main tracking study, including key findings and full technical details, can be found at:\n \nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/ \n\nThe total sample achieved from the first two waves of the tracking study (covering the period May- October 2012) was 10,594, and this provided a robust and substantial base for the further statistical analysis in this report. The main aim of this analysis was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types of interest. There was a particular interest in understanding content infringers in more detail. The following streams of \u2018deep dive\u2019 analysis were undertaken:\n\n1. Decile behavioural analysis among infringers \n\nThis analysis segmented infringers into bands of 10% based on volume of content consumed illegally. This allows insight into the proportion of illegal content for which each decile of infringers is responsible. It is effectively a simple \u2018behavioural\u2019 segmentation based on the volume of infringement. In-depth profiling of the highest infringing decile groups (the top 20%) was then undertaken to allow greater understanding of high-volume infringers. \n\n2. Attitudinal segmentations amongst infringers and non-infringers \n\nIn addition to the decile behavioural analysis which segmented infringers on volume of illegal content consumed, we conducted an \u2018attitudinal\u2019 segmentation. The key inputs for this segmentation were motivations for infringing. Non-infringing consumers were also segmented separately according to their motivations for general online behaviour. Both the behavioural and the attitudinal segmentations can be used to help target groups of consumers based on their motivations. \n\n3. Infringement of multiple content types \n\nThe reports for the tracking study concentrated on general online behaviour and infringement per content type, and across all types. This extra layer of analysis was conducted in order to examine behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed i.e. are people actively infringing across multiple categories, and in what category combinations? \n\n4. Spend analysis among infringers \n\nAdditional analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content. \nFurther details of the specific analysis methodologies employed can be found in the Technical Appendix at the end of this document.",

Details of the data collection method and weighting can be found in the main report: \n\nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/ \n\nThe total sample of the database was 10,594. \n\nIn terms of volumes all respondents were asked about their behaviour during the past three months. However, as the database is combined from two separate waves these two periods differ (May-July and August-October 2012). Therefore, all aggregated volumes are indicative of this six-month period. \n\n\nAnalysis methods \n\nDecile analysis \n* The estimated volume of illegal content was derived for each respondent using the equation: \n* Respondents were grouped into 10% bands using their respective illegal volumes for each content type and at a total level. \n* The cumulative volume of illegal content for each decile band was then calculated and divided by the total number in order to create a percentage of total illegal content accountable for. \n\nSegmentation of infringers \n* The total sample was split into its four natural groupings: non internet users, non-digital consumers (i.e. consumers who do not download, stream or share on line), 100% legal consumers and any illegal consumers. \n* The segments were derived from a factor-cluster analysis using responses to \u2018reasons for infringing\u201917 as well as the volume of infringement. \n* An eight-factor solution was then chosen on the basis of Eigen values and factor comprehension. \n* A two-stage cluster analysis was used to create the cluster seeds While the final cluster solution was \ncreated using a K-means cluster analysis. \n* A four-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of cluster membership homogeneity, cluster heterogeneity and cluster comprehension. \n\nSegmentation of non-infringers \n* The 100% legal consumers were analysed separately from the non-internet users, non-digital consumers and infringing consumers. \n* The segments were created using a similar factor-cluster analysis process as the infringing segmentation. However, the inputs here were the reasons for downloading rather than buying a physical version, and the reasons for streaming or accessing content. \n* A four- and a three-factor solution were chosen, again, on the basis of Eigen values and factor comprehension. \n* A two-stage cluster analysis was used to create the cluster seeds while the final cluster solution was created using a K-means cluster analysis. \n*A four-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of cluster membership homogeneity, and cluster heterogeneity, as well as cluster comprehension. \n* A count variable was created on respondent level data for the number of content types for which the individual consumed infringed content, using the derived illegal file calculation outline in section 3.2: \n*This was repeated for 100% illegal consumption over the different content types. \n* The attitudes and behaviours of the different platform groups were then further analysed.",

The purpose was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types. The work revealed the following:\n\n\nDecile analysis: A more detailed look at the Top 20% Infringers\n\nInfringers were segmented into 10% groups according to the overall volume of content they indicated they had accessed illegally. The main findings were as follows:\n\n* The Top 10% Infringers accounted for just 1.6% of the 12+ internet user population, but were responsible for 79% of infringed content. The Top 20% infringers, accounting for 3.2% of 12+ internet users, were responsible for 88% of infringements.\n* Infringers were more male, 16-34 and ABC1 than the general internet population. However, the Top 20% Infringers were even more likely to be male and 16-34 than the Bottom 80%. (We used the Top 20% Infringers rather than the Top 10% Infringers as the larger sample size makes comparisons more robust).\n* Despite their high levels of infringement, the Top 20% Infringers also accounted for 11% of the legal content consumed.\n* The Top 20% Infringers also spent significantly more across all content types on average than either the Bottom 80% Infringers or the non-infringing consumers (\u00a3168 vs. \u00a3105 vs. \u00a354 over the six month period covered).\n\n\nInfringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting by volume of content infringed, we also segmented infringers by their reasons for doing it. This resulted in four distinct infringing groups:\n\n1. Justifying Infringers (9% of infringers, 24% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the highest levels of infringement. They felt they had spent enough on content already, and this sentiment was confirmed by their high total spend offline. Most of their digital consumption was streamed and primarily related to music, though they also consumed the highest proportion of illegal books across the segments. Generally, they like to try before they buy (related to their willingness to spend) and appear to be the most receptive to good/well-priced legal alternatives.\n\n2. Digital Transgressors (9% of infringers, 22% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the youngest infringing group, with the majority in education. They had the highest levels of downloading behaviour and had higher consumption of films and TV programmes than the other high infringing group (Justifying Infringers). This group showed the least remorse about infringing material, but also had the highest fear of getting caught. In fact, they appeared to be the most receptive to receiving letters from ISPs alleging infringement.  \n\n3. Free Infringers (42% of infringers, 35% of infringed volume, 10% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis was the largest group and was chiefly defined by the fact they infringed because it was free. They paid for a low proportion of the content they consumed and had the lowest total content spend among the infringing segments. They were responsible for the high majority of illegal consumption of video games and computer software.\n\n4. Ambiguous Infringers (39% of infringers, 20% of infringed volume, 9% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group had the lowest levels of digital consumption and the highest proportion of paid and legal content. They generally offered fewer justifications for infringing and for stopping infringing. This appeared to be linked to their lower levels of infringing activity and a lack of confidence in knowing what is legal.\n\n* Infringers generally consumed more paid and legal content than the non-infringing segments, although this formed a lower proportion of their total consumption than it did for non-infringers.\n* Most infringing segments found it easy to find content on the internet for free which would normally be paid, ranging from 45% for the Ambiguous Infringers to 76% for the Top 20% infringers. Among non-infringers the figures were notably lower, ranging from 28% to 45%.\n\n\nNon-infringing segments\n\nAs well as segmenting the infringers, we also segmented consumers who downloaded or streamed legal content only. The four groups are summarised as follows:\n\n1. Simple Streamers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group was primarily defined by the fact that they only streamed content and didn\u2019t download any. This content largely comprised TV programmes and music and was generally accessed for entertainment and convenience purposes.\n\n2. Simple Downloaders (17% of legal consumers , 13% of total digital consumers):\n\nThey were defined by the fact that they only downloaded and didn\u2019t stream. They consumed less content than the other non-infringing segments, and largely downloaded books and music. Despite this, relatively they had the largest proportion of paid-for content.\n\n3. Paying Consumers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n\nThis group paid for the majority of the content that they consumed, while also spending a lot on offline (such as physical) content.\n\n4. Free Opportunists (14% of legal consumers, 11% of total digital consumers):\n\n100% of this group claimed to download because it is free. They consumed a higher volume of free content than any of the other non-infringing segments.\n\n\nInfringement of multiple content types\n\nWe also analysed behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed.\n\n* Most people (62%) contained their infringement to only one content type of the six measured in the study, and this was predominantly music (42%) or films (28%).\n* Where there was infringement in more than one content type it generally included combinations of music, films and TV programmes. Infringement of computer software and video games was more prevalent among those that had infringed across four or more content types.\n* Those that infringed across multiple content types also infringed a higher volume of content on average.\n* Category spend was highest for those that infringed in three content types. \n\n\nSpend analysis among infringers\n\nFurther analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content, and to assess the revenue potential if infringement could be converted to legal consumption:\n\n* Generally, the data from the survey showed that as people consumed more infringed files they also consumed more legal files, and spent more on legal content.\n* Further assessment on price-sensitivity for music showed that the optimum price infringers were willing to pay (either for single downloadable tracks, or for particular premium subscriptions) generally increased as the volume of infringed content increased. (Although the optimum subscription price was below that currently charged for the first premium tier of a number of UK music streaming services, many also offer free versions, albeit with some service restrictions or limitations).\n* This optimum music price was mapped alongside banded illegal consumption in order to estimate potential additional monthly spend (lost revenue) if all infringed content was paid for at this price.\n* The data suggest that improvements to legal alternatives could potentially convert some music infringers to pay for their content (either by track or monthly) if the price was right. However, the relationship between infringement and spend is complex and the claims people make when asked questions about their likely future behaviour given changes to their options do not always closely reflect their real-life behaviour.",

In particular, this paper explores the factors influencing the negative externality acquisition behavior (NEAB) and test the following hypotheses in a lab experiment.\n\nHypotheses:\n* H1 (risk trade-off): Unlawful product acquisition decreases when the punishment probability increases.\n* H2 (penalty trade-off): Unlawful product acquisition is lower in the tasks with high penalty (\u00a318) than in those in which the amount of the penalty is lower (\u00a36).\nThe following hypotheses follow respectively from our discussion of victimless crimes, high or low marginal damage, wealth and perceived deservingness of the rights holder:\n* H3 (victimless behavior): The presence of a rights holder reduces risk taking that damages him or her relative to an equivalent neutrally framed risk taking task.\n* H4 (low vs high marginal damage): Unlawful product acquisition is higher in the treatments in which the number of consumers per rights holder is higher (10) and the rights holder\u2019s profit is lower (10%) than in those in which the number of consumers is lower (2) and the rights holder\u2019s profit is higher (50%).\n* H5 (wealth): Unlawful product acquisition is higher in the tasks where the rights holder has a high endowment (\u00a322) than in the tasks in which the rights holder has a low endowment (\u00a34).\n* H6 (deservingness): Unlawful product acquisition is lower in the treatments where the rights holder has exerted effort than in the treatments in which the rights holder has exerted no effort.\nThe moral scenario analysis is more exploratory and we do not formulate explicit hypotheses, though it would be reasonable to assume that Kantians should be more law/rule abiding, that one such rule would be not to harm others, and as a result they would be less likely to engage in NEAB.\nIn relation to the social determinants of NEAB, there is a clear prediction:\n* H7 (social norms): NEAB is predicted by observers\u2019 opinion about the social appropriateness of unlawful product acquisition in a particular task/treatment.\n\nResults:\n* H1 is supported. NEAB becomes less frequent when the punishment probability increases.\n* H2 is supported. NEAB is lower when the penalty is higher.\n* H3 is supported. Framing the task in terms of having a victim that is affected by NEAB reduces risky choices relative to purely risky choice tasks.\n* There is almost no evidence for H4, i.e. a low or high marginal return to the rights holder do not seem to matter.\n* H5 is not supported. The probability of consumers engaging in unlawful product acquisition is not higher in the tasks where the rights holder has high wealth (\u00a322) than in the tasks in which the rights holder has low wealth (\u00a34).\n* H6 is supported. The probability of the consumer engaging in unlawful product acquisition is lower in the conditions where the rights holder has exerted effort than in the treatments in which the rights holder has exerted no effort. Consumers care about deservingness to some degree.\n* H7 is strongly supported. Unlawful product acquisition is predicted by social norms, as measured by the Observers\u2019 opinion about the social appropriateness of unlawful product acquisition in a particular task/treatment.\n* Utilitarian-minded subjects may engage less in NEAB.",

The surveys were conducted by Macquarie University for the Australia Council of the Arts. The data in this survey was collected in 2009 using the responses of over a thousand professional artists to a detailed questionnaire. The study uses census data to provide demographic information of the artist population in Australia and highlights changes since the previous studies, including a drop in the number of artists recording professional artist as their main occupation. Data from the survey highlights the income disparity between professional artists and the general population, with a mean average income of A$18,900 derived from the artist\u2019s creative work. Survey data also highlights working patterns, time spent on artistic endeavours and career progression. Matters of financial security and income from non-arts sources are also reported. The study also highlights the contribution artists make with their artistic skills in non-artistic industries, and how digital technologies are changing the arts. The report is aimed at policy-makers, bureaucrats, arts organisations, artists themselves and the wider community.",

This has certainly been the experience of WIPO, who organised a seminar on the role of internet intermediaries vis-\u00e0-vis tackling infringement back in 2005. However, member states were not keen on WIPO subsequently taking a clear, further role in this area and as they only act on member state requests, no further work has been undertaken to develop a harmonised framework or to share best practice by WIPO\"",

Notice and take down approaches have been developed and streamlined in many countries to be very quick\n\n* In some cases, stakeholders have also raised concerns that notice and take down regimes merely displace hosting activity to other countries (c.f. the Dutch case)5 days in the Netherlands; 12 to 35 days in Italy, 15 days in Spain) and inexpensive\n\n* Demand-side action requires new legislation to be brought into place (15 years in Brazil, 5 years in the UK).

In other countries, most notably the US but also Australia researchers have been able to analyse the amount and nature of IP litigation; its duration; the proportion of cases which settle and, in the case of the US, features of firms that are involved in litigation. This has been possible, in part, due to the transparency of the court system (in particular, the online availability of full case histories) and the early establishment of a system to collect information about which patents are being litigated. Greater transparency in the courts (the establishment of electronic databases) would be a very large project and raises a number of issues of privacy and/or confidentiality of commercial information. Nevertheless, a number of courts around the world have taken steps in this direction. A system for reporting patents and trade marks being litigated ought to be relatively straightforward to establish (preferably for both trade marks and patent). This would start to build the basis for long-term research and policy analysis: and could be particularly useful to establish a basis for comparison in case a European patent court is established. In the absence of such a system, a project based on archival work similar to that done by Cremers in Germany might be an option to get a better picture of IP litigation in the UK, albeit expensive depending on the extent of data collection desired.",

The combination of technological progress in both digitization and computer networking has been a challenge for traditional ways of managing intellectual property. Some observers have even questioned whether current models for intellectual property can or should survive in a digital world. For example, there is widespread concern about piracy of popular music and film, both via the network and via bootleg CDs and DVDs. There is also concern about the economic viability of the current model for scholarly publication, or, for that matter traditional forms of publishing such as newspapers and TV network news. These developments have led to a revival of interest in the economics of copying and copyright. In this brief review we examine some of the economic issues in this area, and describe some of the insights that have emerged from this work. We end with some reflections on alternative business models for provision of creative works.",

      "proposition": "* If the copyright term is increased to T + Delta T, society loses the benefits from competition that would have accrued during the period T. On the other hand, extending the term makes the production of intellectual property more profitable, increasing the supply of works. The optimal term balances out these two effects. \n* A clever monopolist might use pre-emptive pricing and set an initial price low enough to discourage sharing. In the limit-pricing equilibrium, the surplus is shared between the monopolist and the consumer. This outcome is due to the fact that the possibility of sharing operates like a competitor for the monopolist, constraining the price that it can charge. Since the monopolist\u2019s price and profit is increasing in the transactions cost of sharing, the monopolist would like these transactions costs to be as large as possible. Hence, it would be interested in seeing greater enforcement of antipiracy laws, technologies that make it costly to copy and similar measure that make copying more costly to consumers.\n* Now that most information is born digital and that digital information is typically very easy to copy and distribute, it is conceivable that copyright laws may become almost impossible to enforce. Some business models might help sellers supporting themselves in an environment without effective copyright: 1) Make the original cheaper than a copy; 2) Make a copy more expensive than the original; 3) Sell physical complements; 4) Sell information complements; 5) Subscriptions; 6) Sell a personalized version; 7) Selling works with digital fingerprints (encoding the identity of the purchaser); 8) Advertise oneself; 9) Advertise other things; 10) Monitoring; 11) Site licenses; 12) Media tax; 13) Ransom; 14) Pure public provision; 15) Prizes, awards and commissions\n* Copyright is a second-best solution to intellectual property provision. Perhaps the ultimate saving grace is that the same technological advances that are making digital content inexpensive to copy are also helping to reduce the fixed cost of content creation. Hundreds of thousands of people are giving away digital content, from blogs to garage video to open source software. The increased availability of content due to the reduction in the cost of creating and distributing it will presumably increase competition and reduce the price consumers pay for legitimate access to content.\n- It is highly unlikely that free content alone will meet all of society\u2019s needs for content. However, free content together with some combination of the business models described in this work and traditional copyright may do an adequate job of satisfying society\u2019s demand for information goods.",

      "proposition": "All else equal, contributory liability is more attractive a) the greater the harm from direct copyright infringement; b) the less the benefit from lawful use of the indirect infringer\u2019s product; c) the lower the costs of modifying the product in ways that cut down infringing activities without substantially interfering with legal ones; and d) the greater the extent to which indirect liability reduces the costs of copyright enforcement as compared to a system that allows only direct liability. Napster is different from a VCR manufacturer because it has low-cost ways of discouraging piracy without impinging on legitimate use. That is the core insight necessary for the design of an efficient indirect liability regime.\n\nAn efficient approach to indirect liability might start by applying a negligence rule to any activity that can lead to copyright infringement. The difference is that current law focuses on knowledge, control, the extent of any noninfringing uses and other factors without being particularly clear as to why those issues are central. An explicit negligence rule would lay bare the underlying logic of the indirect liability inquiry. One drawback to the modern implicit negligence approach is that, as applied to new technologies, it can engender considerable uncertainty. A producer responsible for a new audio recording device, for example, might find it difficult to predict what courts will require in the new setting. In response, such a producer might choose to be excessively cautious. This explains the safe harbor provision introduced by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act However, , competition in the market for Internet service provision should mitigate this problem.\n\nIn addition to negligence liability and safe harbors, an efficient indirect liability regime might also include a tailored tax applicable to particular tools, services or venues associated with copyright infringement.\n\nSometimes indirect liability should not be an option. The costs in terms of unavoidable interference with legitimate products might be too high, and society would therefore be better off forcing copyright holders to rely on other mechanisms.

The ALRC\u2019s recommendation in favour of fair use is based predominantly on a legal analysis and did not include an economic cost-benefit analysis (CBA). From an economic perspective it is clear that they may be new disincentives to create works with the introduction of a 'fair use' provision. As a result, the core task of this analysis is to determine, based on the available evidence, whether it is likely that the economic benefits arising from secondary use will more than offset the economic loss for original local producers.

      "abstract": "Technological protection measures (TPMs) are the hard core of digital rights management (DRM) systems, which enforce the rights of the copyright owner in the digital environment. Copyright scholars expressed concerns that TPMs do not comply with copyright exceptions and limits (Hugenholtz 2000; Koelman 2000; Dusollier 2003; Westkamp 2004). A few solutions to this problem have been proposed in the field of internet services (Mulligan and Burstein 2002; Erickson 2003; Cohen and Burk 2001; Sobel 2003). However, none of these proposals is tailored to optical disks (CDs and DVDs). Yet, the report \u2018Digital Broadband Content: Music\u2019 of the OECD (2005) states that TPMs implemented on optical disks hinder copyright exceptions more often than those applied to internet services. Moreover, in Europe the Copyright Directive exempts TPMs implemented on internet services from compliance with copyright exceptions. This paper therefore outlines possible ways to implement TPMs on optical disks in Europe, in order to achieve their compliance with a list of fundamental copyright exceptions, as identified by previous research (Favale 2008).",

This implies that the associated cost with running collective and individual licensing systems may become an important criterion when implementing a new solution for the regulation of orphan works.\n\n*  According to the authors, a legislator must make a decision on what is deemed to be the desired behaviour.

The paper also questions whether lessons can be learned from the entertainment industry and the manner in which this industry has attempted to deal with online piracy. The paper suggests that rather than focusing on stringent IP laws, the future in dealing with emerging technologies which challenges IP laws lie in adopting new business models in adapting to technologies such as 3D printing.",

The drawback of this model is the risk of creating a monopoly. The entertainment industry welcomed Apple\u2019s iTunes business model when it was launched and was in fact reluctant to license to anyone else. Now, with Apple having the upper hand or the monopoly, the entertainment industry is in constant negotiation with Apple regarding their pricing strategy. The stakeholder most likely to lose out from such negotiations is the artist. In the present context, it could be the manufacturer who could be losing out. Bearing in mind the above drawback, maybe a better option would be to license 3D files more widely\n\n* On a more practical level, stores should consider having a physical presence and an online presence with a 3D arm attached to the online store as well\u2014where 3D designs can be sold for a competitive price. \n\n* It is hoped that the law will not stifle 3D printing\n\n* The time will come when significant decisions will need to be made. At that time, one option will be to follow in the footsteps of the entertainment industry and shy away from the technology, thereby enforcing stricter intellectual property laws; or be more creative by adapting to the emerging 3D technology by adopting new business models. In learning valuable lessons from the entertainment industry\u2019s experience, the hope is that the latter option will be chosen.",

While 3D printing a product may not infringe one element of IP law, it is quite possible that it will breach another type of IP. To complicate matters, the above assessment also revealed that the same branch of IP can lead to both infringement and non-infringement of protected products which are 3D printed. For example, while under s.10 of TMA 1994, it will be an infringement to print a product protected by a trade mark, s.11(2) states that if labelled correctly, infringement can be avoided\n\n* Similar to online platforms such as Napster, Grokster, Pirate Bay and Megaupload which facilitated and induced online infringement of copyright, it is quite possible that new online platforms such as Thingiverse, Shapeways, Cubify and Quirky will facilitate 3D printing of products\u2014which are protected by IP laws\u2014in time to come. However, unlike MP3 files and video copying which produced perfect copies, the same will not be true for 3D printing. \n\n* The material that will be needed to carry out 3D printing, could prove to be a challenge, but this could be an opportunity for the start-up of new businesses and business ventures specialising in raw materials which will be needed for 3D printing. At present prices vary from \u20ac30 to \u20ac218 depending on the amount of raw material needed\n\n* It is difficult to compete with free \u2014i.e. pirated and counterfeit content which is available online for free",

      "abstract": "The great virtue of the notice and takedown process for online services is its proceduralism. To take the most common example, if a service reliant on user-generated content follows the statutory procedures, acts on notices, and otherwise lacks specific knowledge of user infringement on its site (the complicated \"red flag\" knowledge standard), it can claim safe harbor protection in the event of a lawsuit. Services can make decisions about taking down material based on substantive review and their tolerance for risk. They may also adopt technologies or practices to supplement notice and takedown, though the law makes no such demands beyond a requirement for repeat infringer policies. The resulting balance has enabled a relatively broad scope for innovation in search and user-generated-content services. As one entrepreneur put it in our recent study of these issues, notice and takedown was \"written into the DNA\" of the Internet sector. The rights holder companies are slowly winning on enforcement and the largest Internet companies have become powerful enough to fend off changes in law that could threaten their core business models.",

In 2009, Google\u2019s search service received less than 100 takedown requests. In 2014, it received 345 million requests.\n\n* As automated notices overwhelmed small legal teams, targeted services lost the ability to fully vet the complaints they received. Because companies exposed themselves to high statutory penalties if they ignored valid complaints, the safest path afforded by the DMCA was to remove all targeted material. Some companies did so. Some responded by developing automated triage procedures that prioritized high-risk notices for human review (most commonly, those sent by individuals).\n\n* The DMCA+ measures included the use of content filtering systems, such as YouTube\u2019s ContentID and Audible Magic. They included special takedown privileges for trusted senders; expanded profiling of users; restrictive terms of service; modifications to search functionality; and other approaches that stretched beyond the DMCA\u2019s requirements.\n\n* Smaller services sometimes ceded control of takedown to rights holder groups, in some cases via direct back-end administrative access. Larger services with more leverage sought to retain control but, in some cases, adopted blocking or content filtering systems as part of their risk assessments.\n\n* Today, for online services with significant copyright exposure, the DMCA\u2019s procedural balance is, practically speaking, obsolete. Practices shift the balance of protection from users to rights holders, and hold out the statutory remedies as, at best, last resorts for user and services\n\n* According to smaller services surveyed, traditional DMCA compliance appears fragile\u2014dependent on rights holder forbearance or inattention that could change at any time.\n\n* Google takes down 97.5% of requests.

The \u201cprivate investment\u201d model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection.

This paper investigates the optimal mix of direct and indirect subsidies to the university, in a context where the role of university research is to turn up \"ideas\" for commercial investments, and the role of commerce is to turn the ideas into innovations. It also asks whether there is an argument for protecting \"ideas\" as well as commercializations, as is authorized by the Bayh-Dole Act.",

One factor that has received a good deal of attention is the \u2018sampling\u2019 effect.

However, improvers cannot always avoid the intellectual property rights of the basic work on which they wish to improve. Some improvements fall within the scope of the preexisting intellectual property right, either because of an expansive definition of that right or because economic or technical necessity requires that the improver hew closely to the work of the original creator in some basic respect.

It considers specific topics in the economic analysis of law and proposes new models and approaches for addressing these topics. The analysis of the article is organized into three categories: positive, prescriptive, and normative. Positive analysis of law concerns how agents behave in response to legal rules and how legal rules are shaped. Prescriptive analysis concerns what rules should be adopted to advance specified ends. Normative analysis attempts to assess more broadly the ends of the legal system: Should the system always respect people's choices? By drawing attention to cognitive and motivational problems of both citizens and government, behavioral law and economics offers answers distinct from those offered by the standard analysis.",

These points bear on the supply of and the demand for law, and on the behavior of agents in their interactions with the legal system\n\n* Many laws which are seemingly inefficient and do not benefit powerful interest groups may be explained on grounds of judgments about right and wrong.\n\n* Cognitive difficulties and motivational distortions undermine or alter conventional economic prescriptions about the jury's role, most notably in the context of assessing negligence and making other factual determinations\n\n* A behavioural approach raises serious doubts about the reflexive antipaternalism of some of economic analysis of law. On the other hand, it raises equivalent questions about whether even well-motivated public officials will be able to offer appropriate responses to private mistakes and confusion.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines direct broadcast satellites (DBS) as a competitor to cable. We first estimate a structural consumer level demand system for satellite, basic cable, premium cable and local antenna using micro data on almost 30000 households in 317 markets, including extensive controls for unobserved product quality and allowing the distribution of unobserved tastes to follow a fully flexible multivariate normal distribution. The estimated elasticity of expanded basic is about -15, with the demand for premium cable and DBS more elastic. The results identify strong correlations in the taste for different products not captured in conventional logit models. Estimates of the supply response of cable suggest that without DBS entry cable prices would be about 15 percent higher and cable quality would fall. We find a welfare gain of between $127 and $190 per year (aggregate $2.5 billion) for satellite buyers, and about $50 (aggregate $3 billion) for cable subscribers.",

What emerges from the case law and the copyright statute is a focus on individual types of transactions, not a concern with restructuring an entire set of markets to reach ideal goals, and an identification of those imperfections that will not be tolerated because of their particular impact on dissemination and the ultimate goals of copyright. That transactional emphasis is the proper one. It allows particularly desirable transfers that are blocked by market failure to go forward outside the market, but also allows the courts to impose liability where widespread use of this bypass would cause substantial injury to the copyright owner.",

The copyright system in the UK is undergoing a gradual process of reform to reflect this new reality. \nIn 2006, Andrew Gowers, a former editor of the Financial Times, presented a report into the state of intellectual property in the U.K. Among his policy recommendations were three proposed changes to the copyright exceptions system which alter the way in which consumers can interact with copyrighted works. Gowers proposed introducing copyright exceptions for:\n\n* Format shifting, for instance the transfer of a piece of music from a CD to an mp3 player.\n\n* Parody, caricature and pastiche.\n\n* Creative, transformative or derivative works. In our context, this definition includes user-generated content.\n\nOur review examines the existing literature on the possible economic effects of these proposed changes to the copyright exceptions system, specifically whether the introduction of these proposed changes would cause economic damage to rights-holders.

However, there are other important considerations that might reverse this conclusion. \n\n* The economists\u2019 second point (new works) is not as clear-cut and is incompletely explored in the brief.\n\n* The data that economists would need, but do not have, include (1) the number and value of new works created as a result of extensions of copyright duration; (2) the reduction of surplus for reproductions of copyrighted materials under extended copyright, relative to the surplus that would be generated if copyright protection were less lengthy\n\n* There is a possibility that for some authors, in some range of income and propensity to create, a small increase in present value could make an important difference in creative output, perhaps because they reach a point where they switch to full-time writing\n\n* An unpublished empirical research carried out by Lebowitz in the 1980s back up anecdotal evidence \u2014 that the distribution of book sales is very highly skewed toward the more successful book titles. \n\n* More than half of the best-sellers in the 236 sample remained in print for a long enough period of time that the 1976 extension to the copyright law would likely have affected the present value of future book sales \n\n*  Even for non-best-sellers, a third still survived after fifty-eight years, indicating that a fairly significant share of other important books would likely be affected by changes in copyright law even when the copyright term is quite long.\n\n* The inferences about depreciation rates of books drawn from overall survival rates are likely to be misleading.

      "abstract": "The transmission of digitized music files, particularly on filesharing networks, is having a profound impact on the consumption and production of music. Although previous forms of copying have been found to often have benign effects on copyright owners, the rise in file-sharing has coincided with a steep decline in the sale of sound recordings. This paper attempts to empirically examine whether file-sharing has caused the decline in record sales. It examines the size and pattern of file-sharing and its theoretical impact on record sales. Using a data set for 99 American cities containing information on Internet use, record sales, and other demographic variables, an econometric analysis is undertaken to explain the change in record sales before and after file-sharing. The results imply that file-sharing has caused the entire decline in record sales that has occurred and also appears to have vitiated what otherwise would have been fairly robust growth in the industry. Looking at sales in individual musical genres reinforces the primary conclusions. The record industry\u2019s risky strategy of assiduously fighting filesharing, therefore, appears to have a rational basis.",

This paper addresses that question by providing an economic summary of how the markets for music, film and books have changed. Our paper focuses on three industries, music, film and books, where the industry structure evolved under a long-term regime of robust copyright protection. In each industry, we first discuss the stages of the traditional supply chain.\nSecond, we discuss the effects of digitization on that traditional supply chain, focusing on how digitization has radically reduced distribution costs, while simultaneously increasing the potential for piracy of content. Third, we provide a brief history of how new business models for the distribution of content in each industry have fared thus far.

However, this approach works only if producers are able to capture adequate compensation to produce at the socially desirable level. \n\n* If a copyright scheme fails to create enforceable ownership rights, producers of intellectual works will not receive adequate compensation for their initial investment and will therefore face reduced production incentives. This is the situation that digital distribution threatens to create.\n\n* Unless addressed through novel business models, the resultant market failure could require legal innovation (perhaps in the form of compulsory blanket licenses) to ensure that producers have adequate incentive to create original works. \n\n* Each of the three main functions of record companies\u2014finding talent, recording music, and promoting/distributing songs\u2014has been affected by digitization and internet distribution.\n\n* Digitization has had its greatest impact in the post-theatrical release segment of the film industry, which has been dominated by physical DVDs for the past 8 to 10 years. Online distribution of digitized movies has been possible since 1997. Nevertheless, revenues from online distribution have been relatively modest for the past five years due to both low sales volumes and relatively lower prices for online content. \n\n* Online distribution is becoming increasingly important to the industry at the same time that TVs are increasingly integrated with internet connectivity.",

Innovative firms, it is argued, would have insufficient incentive to innovate should the prospect of monopoly power not be present. This theme of monopoly runs throughout the theory of growth, international trade, and industrial organization. We argue that monopoly is neither needed for, nor a necessary consequence of innovation. In particular, intellectual property is not necessary for, and may hurt more than help, innovation and growth. We show that, in most circumstances, competitive rents allow creative individuals to appropriate a large enough share of the social surplus generated by their innovations to compensate for their opportunity cost. We also show that, as the number of pre-existing and IP protected ideas needed for an innovation increases, the equilibrium outcome under the IP regime is one of decreasing probability of innovation, while this is not the case without IP. Finally, we provide various examples of how competitive markets for innovative products would work in the absence of IP and critically discuss a number of common fallacies in the previous literature.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to map discourses and counter-discourses through which online piracy has been framed and constructed in Swedish blogs and online news. It has been common in previous analyses of moral public debates about new forms of media consumption to focus on conservative top-down hegemonic processes of reinstating order. The classic moral panic literature overemphasizes control, power and hegemony while overlooking counter-discourses. This study, on the other hand, takes such forms of symbolic resistance into account. It relies on a comparative discursive network analysis of texts produced by corporate news organizations and of blogs representing pro-piracy perspectives. It is concluded that with the blurring of the boundaries between producers and consumers of content, more and more localized moral panics that are not necessarily hegemonic are likely to be seen. Panic reactions can run not only from the top down but also from the bottom up as niche and micro media instigate their own moral panics.",

It does so within the context of a changing digital media environment that calls for a reassessment of key dimensions: networks, globalization, technology, space and the state. More specifically, it focuses on the operation of film piracy networks in Greater China that includes the Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. By zooming in on `Greater China', this article presents empirical accounts of specific links and connections on and between the intersecting distribution and piracy networks. In sum, distribution and piracy in China highlight some of the most interesting and intricate insights into issues of power, control, technology, network, speed, global-regional-national dynamics, subjectivities and reflexivity. Given the complexity of the issues, this study argues for a spatial, network and process-oriented theoretical framework.",

      "abstract": "Economists have long recognised that copyright collecting societies (CCS), i.e. organisations that specialise on administering \"copyrights held by a large number of owners\", play a fundamental role in the copyright system. Indeed, the economic literature explains why without such organisations, copyright law would be ineffective in some markets for copyrighted works: the majority of authors and users would not be able to grant or obtain permission to use many works of art, literature, music, film and other such works that copyright law protects. In economic terms, CCS enable markets to function for the use of copyright works in situations in which the copyright holder cannot contract directly with the user. But because many markets for copyright works have changed rapidly over recent years, we should ask under which circumstances CCS would continue to play a constructive, maybe even essential, role. It has been argued many times that technical solutions to digital rights management (DRM) will render CCS obsolete as the market for copyrights shifts online and policy-makers such as the European Commission have begun to scrutinise the role played by CCS in the dynamic market for copyrighted media content online (REC 2005/737/EC). The purpose of this survey of the specialised economic literature is to take stock and to identify possible gaps in the understanding of the economics of CCS and to advocate attention to this literature in contemporary debates about them.",

That is, some units (the copies) are \"sold\" at one price (zero) while other units are sold at a higher price. Ceteris paribus, when network externalities are present, the firm has a greater incentive to expand output because marginal revenue is higher, and in some cases the firm may wish to create a preemptive installed base\n\n* Inframarginal consumers purchase originals at a price that may largely appropriate the externality of increased network size created by copier\n\n* Without copying, the same network size may only be obtained at a possibly lower price (and certainly positive marginal cost) on all existing units.\n\n* Profits may be greater with copying even if all deterred pirates subsequently purchase\n\n* The presence of copying with network effects can also be a relatively efficient means of achieving long-run strategic outcomes",

We show that enlarging the copyright holder's captive market through more extensive copyright enforcement reduces prices toward the monopoly level, increases sales of legitimate copies and can increase consumer surplus. Therefore, in contrast with the case of more intensive copyright enforcement, more extensive copyright enforcement over some range can increase the incentive to generate intellectual property while also reducing the loss to consumers from monopoly power.",

For the underproduction problem, we support the claim that an increase in copyright protection will decrease the social welfare loss due to underproduction. The change, however, is not gradual. We show that the social welfare loss due to underproduction is a step function which takes a downward jump to zero at a threshold level of copyright protection. In addition to investigating the common claims, we specify the optimal level of copyright protection for an individual producer and the society as a whole. For an\nindividual producer, the optimal level of copyright protection is: (i) no protection, (ii) the level under which the producer\u2019s overall profit net of the development cost is zero, or (iii) full protection. We provide conditions under which one of these\nprotection levels is an optimal level.We also discuss the optimal level of copyright protection when there exist many firms, each of which may produce a specific copyrightable product.

Although the emphasis is on the economic analysis, it also briefly presents the legal context and its recent evolution. As digital piracy consists in infringing intellectual property laws, it is important to start by understanding the rationale of such laws. That allows a more precise definition of what is meant by digital piracy. The study then moves on to the economic analysis of piracy, starting with the basic analysis, which explains why piracy is likely to decrease the profits of the producers of digital products; also examined is how the producers have reacted to digital piracy when it started to grow. Next is a review of more recent contributions to the field that point at possible channels through which piracy could improve the profitability of digital products. These channels have inspired new business models for the distribution of digital products, which are described in the last part of the essay. Throughout the essay are reported the results of some of the most recent empirical studies, so as to quantify the impacts of digital piracy.",

What has been termed the Paradox of Power (Hirshleifer, 1991) is the observation that very often the reverse occurs: poorer or weaker contestants improve their position relative to richer or stronger opponents. In warfare, small nations have often defeated larger ones, as notably occurred in Vietnam. Individuals, groups, or nations - if rational and self-interested - will equalize the marginal returns of two main ways of generating income: production and mutually advantageous exchange, versus appropriate efforts designed to redistribute income or capture resources previously controlled by other parties.",

Of these, the major question was the degree to which the experimental outcomes approximated the noncooperative Nash solution, as opposed to a more cooperative outcome generating a larger in- come for the group as a whole. We also compared protocols with randomly varying partners each round as opposed to fixed partners over the entire sequence of play. (2) The second group of predictions dealt with inferences from the specific model of conflict in Hirshleifer ( 1991 ), and specifically those associated with the Paradox of Power. The paradox is that, in many situations, an initially poorer side will end up gaining in relative position in comparison with an initially richer and thus stronger opponent. With regard to the first group of predictions, the experimental observations overwhelmingly supported the Nash as opposed to the Cooperative solution. However, while the Nash solution is much better supported in a dichotomous comparison between the two, the experimental results typically displayed some degree of slippage in the direction of cooperation. The convergence toward Nash was weaker under the fixed partners as opposed to the varying partners protocol, and also was weaker in the mature (sixteenth round) choices than the overall behavior. Together with an observed tendency toward positive correlation of the deviations from the Nash equilibrium, these results are consistent with a \"leaming to cooperate\" interpretation. Fixed partners over multiple rounds of interaction favor the development of mutual understanding relative to varying partners. Still, we must reemphasize, overall the results were dominated by noncooperative (Nash) behavior.",

Therefore, we have argued that piracy may be bad for social welfare since in the long run it may reduce musical variety. To conclude, let us briefly note that this negative result is mitigated when piracy, through its effect on recognition, has a positive impact on the probability of a relatively unpopular artist to become a star, as in Alcal\u00e1 and Gonz\u00e1lez-Maestre (2010), which is likely to be the case in the presence of imperfections in the talent revelation process (Tervi\u00f6, 2009, see).",

We address this issue using an extended spatial competition model that explicitly considers licensing provisions and inefficiencies in policy administration. The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, there are different socially beneficial policy choices, such as protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding.

The revenues may be reduced when a free-riding reuser creates a competing database by extracting the contents from the creator's database. Thus, creators would like to have certain means of protecting the contents in their databases. Without adequate protection, the incentives of creating  such databases could diminish.

Civil sanctions will probably be sufficient for creating the optimal amount of infringing behavior. For copyright infringement, civil sanctions alone should be sufficient to deter nearly all types of harmful conduct. There is an economic case for imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement only with respect to a discrete set of activities: massive reproduction and sales of commercially valuable works. We have arrived at the conclusion that the case for criminal IP sanctions is weak or nonexistent while putting to one side both noneconomic considerations, such as moral or deontological objections to criminal IP sanctions, and economic concerns about the efficacy of IP in promoting innovation. Once those considerations are added to the calculus, we suspect that the argument for criminal sanctions for IP infringement will disintegrate almost entirely.",

      "abstract": "Since the launch of the iTunes Music Store in the US in 2003 and in much of Europe in the following years, music trade has shifted rapidly from physical to digital products, raising the availability of products in different countries. Despite substantial growth in availability, choice sets have not converged across countries; and observers point to copyright-related transaction costs as an obstacle to greater availability. Policy makers are now contemplating various copyright reforms that could reduce these trade costs. The possibility of these changes raises the question of how much benefit they would create for consumers and producers around the world. We address these questions with a structural model of supply and demand for music in 17 countries, which we employ to counterfactually simulate the effect of a European digital single market (the equivalent of a pan-European copyright regime) on the welfare of consumers and producers. We also simulate autarky and worldwide frictionless trade - in which all products are available in all countries - allowing us to quantify both the conventional gains from status quo trade as well as the maximum possible gains available to free trade. Existing and additional trade have different patterns of benefit to consumers and producers. Status quo trade benefits consumers everywhere, but European consumers have benefited more than North Americans. Existing trade has had large benefits to American producers but on balance small benefits to European producers. Additional trade would continue the pattern of consumers benefits with larger gains to European consumers but would reverse the pattern for producers. Greater availability of products resulting from easing of copyright restrictions would raise per capita gains to producers in Europe more than in North America.

Under worldwide frictionless trade consumers in 15 European countries gain \u20ac31 million (a 3% increase) while North American consumers gain \u20ac6.5 million (a 0.35% increase). Most of the gains from fully frictionless trade - about two thirds - are accomplished by a European single market.

Clearly, the additional gains from moving beyond a European Digital Single Market to a worldwide open market would be small for European producers and consumers.

The paper is not intended to be a full literature survey, but rather attempts to identify the main areas that have been studied, and to offer an overview of what the literature says by means of an analysis of representative publications. The principal objective is to attempt to provide guidance to economists interested in undertaking empirical research on the economics of copyright, particularly in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. I shall attempt to provide an identification of areas for further research and suitable methodological approaches that could be followed by economists, especially in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, to study the economics of copyright empirically. To that end, the paper will address the following general topics: (1) papers dealing specifically with supply side effects (earnings from copyright royalties, the effect of copyright law on creativity, collective management of copyright); (2) papers dealing specifically with demand side effects (willingness to pay by consumers of copyright products, copyright infringement or piracy); (3) papers concerning emerging mechanisms for exercising rights over protected works. The paper concludes with a section that addresses directly the issue of copyright for developing countries.",

That is, firms that have more patents and/or perceive patents as an effective appropriability device, tend to have higher patent propensities \u2013 in other words, patenting decisions would be related to the firm\u2019s patenting history and its perception of the strength of patents as a protection tool.",

Member States also are required to award the rightholder the reasonable costs of investigating, taking legal action against, and rectifying the infringement.\nAs the IPRED has been implemented in national legislation and carried out in practice, however, the rightholder often cannot recover in full the compensation appropriate to an infringement, or the full costs that the rightholder has borne to redress the infringement. Some do not award compensation for all relevant types of damage. Many limit the types and amount of costs that can be recovered. Some courts are unwilling to award damages with respect to infringements and damage that clearly have taken place but are difficult to quantify precisely.\nThese legal and practical drawbacks mean that some of the profit or other economic benefit of an infringement often remains with the infringer even after the rightholder has brought a \u201csuccessful\u201d civil case, or that some of the cost of litigation or other cost of redressing that infringement is borne by the rightholder rather than by the infringer. As a result, damages and costs awards can effectively leave the rightholder in a worse position, and the infringer in a better position, than either would have been in had the infringement and the civil litigation not occurred. Such a state of affairs provides not a deterrent but rather an economic incentive to engage in infringement and an economic penalty for enforcing IPR rights through civil action.",

      "abstract": "As a result of external pressures and to meet its own economic objectives, China has been moving its intellectual property rights (IPR) regime closer to those found in many more developed nations. As China's economy grows, its transition from manufacturing-based to knowledge-based production, more comprehensive laws, and more attention to enforcement have led to an increase in the number of IPR infringement cases being brought before the courts or taken up through China's administrative procedures. In this paper, the authors analyze the changing role of IPR enforcement in China and examines trends in damages awards in IPR cases in China, using a proprietary database, developed by NERA, of cases filed in China between 2002 and 2008.

Consequently, most studies suggest that fines represent only a\ntiny fraction of the estimated sales revenue lost to IPR holders.\nThe review by the authors also suggests judicial damage awards for IPR violations in China are low\ncompared to the United States and compared to the likely degree of harm caused.\nFurthermore, although the frequency of damage awards in IPR cases in China has\nincreased, the average amount awarded has not increased. However, each year there\nappear to be a few cases which involve significant damages, and these high damage\nawards appear to be occurring more frequently each year. It also appears that, while\ndamage awards tend to be low, IPR owners typically make low damages claims.",

Under this law individuals receive a warning the first two times they are detected illegally sharing content through peer to peer (P2P) networks. Legal action is only taken when a third violation is detected. We analyze the impact of this law on individual behavior. Our theoretical model of illegal behavior under a graduated response law predicts that the perceived probability of detection has no impact on the decision to initially engage in digital piracy, but may reduce the intensity of illegal file sharing by those who do pirate. We test the theory using survey data from French Internet users. Our econometric results indicate that the law has no substantial deterrent effect. In addition, we find evidence that individuals who are better informed about the law and piracy alternatives substitute away from monitored P2P networks and illegally access content through unmonitored channels.",

      "abstract": "This research study is an investigation into the consumption of digital music. Rapid growth in the market for digital music has been led by the rise in popularity of online download stores such as iTunes and streaming services. Consumers now have the option to acquire songs from a variety of paid and non-paid legitimate sources, as well as through unlawful channels. At the same time, rights holders have attempted to re-commodify a product that has been decommodified\nthrough copyright infringement. Drawing from the theory of planned behavior, this study places emphasis on the role of norms and attitudes in the formation of intentions to either purchase music or download it for free. It will be shown that these preferences affect the treatment of digital music as a cultural object. A political economy framework is used to understand negative attitudes towards attempts to control digital music distribution. An online questionnaire was designed and completed by a total of (n = 162) consumers. The data was analyzed using a mixed-method approach in order to triangulate quantitative results.\nThe results indicate that a large portion of consumers are willing to pay for digital music. However, they are not encouraged by the threat of legal repercussions. Despite being satisfied with the streaming service, users are not willing to subscribe. The youngest consumers hold favorable attitudes towards illegal downloading which is grounded in a norm of copyright infringement and belief in the Internet as free. Finally, it was found that affinity for the recording artist serves to moderate intentions to download illegally. Overall, the results have implications for measures to counter digital piracy and to encourage willingness to pay. Furthermore, they question the long-term viability of the subscription-revenue streaming business model.",

Many scholars and librarians dream of creating a \"universal digital library,\" where high-quality resources are accessible from their desktops. Realizing this dream-creating a digital library that is comparable to an excellent traditional library and providing open access to it,- require negotiating copyright permission. \nThis report focuses on three efforts at Carnegie Mellon University to acquire copyright permission to digitize and provide open access to books-that is, to make books freely available on the Internet for public use. \nTo provide a context for the studies that form the basis of this report, the report begins with an overview of copyright laws, licensing practices, and technological developments that have brought about dramatic changes in the cost and dissemination of scholarly information. This section also describes the impact that these changes have had on research, learning, and libraries. The three studies, including data analyses that explore the response and success rates with different types of publishers and publications and transaction costs, are then presented in detail. Anecdotes illuminate the effort required and problems encountered in trying to acquire copyright permission for open access, from the difficulty of determining copyright status and ownership and locating copyright owners to the questions, concerns, record-keeping methods, and changing contractual practices that constrain publishers' embrace of open access. The report describes how lessons learned in each study were applied in the next study and the benefits of flexible and innovative approaches to acquiring copyright permission.",

      "abstract": "This article is a case study, detailing the decision-making process for digitising a large collection of advertisements that fell within the period since 1923 and therefore likely subject to copyright.\n\nCreating access to digital images of historic documents, images, and maps is a vital service that  many libraries and archives are providing for their patrons, local and international. And with most on-line collections, web visitors are able to see the items while using enhanced searching and browsing capabilities to find them. This capability expands the usability of the on-line collections in ways traditional finding aids and box lists cannot match. There is a wealth of interesting and helpful material in most libraries - and as long as items are truly historic (19th Century and before) and without literary or copyright claims, the process of creating online collections is straightforward. Find the items, scan them, provide access: more primary resources on the web (though the process is a little more complicated than that). Creating an online resource for more recent historical documents (i.e., created or published less than 78 years ago) adds another large layer of difficulty to the task.\nThe Digital Scriptorium at Duke University creates on-line projects for a variety of collections, ranging from ancient papyri to 20th-Century photography. For the most part, everything that has been made available by the Scriptorium has either been out of copyright or, in the case of the photos, the library owns the copyright to the items themselves. \nThe Ad*Access project, however, presented an entirely new challenge. Ad*Access, an on-line database, gives researchers around the world images and information for more than 7,000 advertisements printed primarily in U.S. newspapers and magazines between 1911 and 1955. It is the collaborative effort of the Digital Scriptorium and the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History. Generously supported by the Duke Endowment \"Library 2000\" Fund, Ad*Access was created using materials in the J. Walter Thompson Company Competitive Advertisements Collection. \nThe vast majority of the advertisements chosen for this project were created and published after 1923. Clearly beyond the copyright-free zone, the library had to answer the question of whether the pursuit of copyright permission was necessary, as the project was created by an educational institution for research and study. In other words, did the project fall within fair use? \nThis article describes how that decision was made and the implications of that decision. The author includes citations from copyright law and other resources dealing with intellectual property and fair use. The author, however, is NOT a lawyer, and does not purport to offer legal advice in any way. The emphasis of the article is to describe our project's efforts in resolving the question of copyright for Ad*Access.",

      "abstract": "This report presents the findings from interviews conducted with 26 employees involved in different aspects of the digitisation projects at seven New Zealand Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs). The research project focused on copyright law and the digitisation of CHIs\u2019 collections. The digitisation of M\u0101ori cultural heritage adds another dimension to the activities of New Zealand CHIs, and this area was also explored in the interviews. \n\nThe objectives of CHIs are to protect, preserve, and facilitate accessibility to cultural entities in the interests of research and education, and the general public interest in cultural matters. In line with overseas practice, New Zealand\u2019s CHIs make use of digital technologies to achieve their objectives. However, many items in CHIs\u2019 collections are protected by copyright. To make a copy of such items without the consent of the copyright owner is an infringement of copyright. Nevertheless, for various reasons including those that are linked to copyright law itself, as well as practical matters such as inadequate resourcing for CHIs to trace absent copyright owners, and a lack of metadata relating to some items in CHIs\u2019 collections, most digitisation projects in CHIs proceed without the consent of copyright owners. Indeed, there is very little understanding within CHIs of the complexities of copyright law and how it relates to the practices of digitisation of their collections. \n\nIn essence, the permitted exceptions in the Copyright Act 1994 (\u201cthe Copyright Act\u201d) which are intended to support the preservation and archiving of cultural heritage (\u201cthe archiving exceptions\u201d) are, similarly to equivalent provisions in overseas copyright legislation, unsuitable in a digital environment. For example, the archiving exceptions permit a single digital copy of an item to be made, whereas digitisation inevitably results in multiple copies. In addition, it is unclear whether the archiving exceptions apply to CHIs that are museums. \n\nIn part, this gap between practice and law appears to exist because the broader purposes of digitisation of CHI collections were misconceived by the legislators. This research found that CHIs digitise their collections because they wish to provide accessibility to a more widespread audience. Conversely, the archiving exceptions have been drafted with a view that the main purpose of digitisation is similar to that of analogue reproduction; that is, to preserve a copy of an item in a collection that is in danger of deterioration. \n\nAnother reason for the inadequacy of the archiving exceptions is that, as for all permitted exceptions in national copyright laws, these provisions are required to comply with each of the \u201cthree step test\u201d provisions in Article 13 of the Agreement of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (\u201cthe TRIPS Agreement\u201d). Part 8 of this report suggests that the three step test requirement can be satisfied while nevertheless providing more appropriate exceptions for CHIs. \n\nWhile CHIs\u2019 practices in the area of digitisation of M\u0101ori cultural heritage appear, on the whole, to be robust this report proposes that to provide certainty a new provision to regulate this activity should be inserted into the Copyright Act. The report concludes by recommending further amendments to the Copyright Act to address the current gap between practice and the law that has been revealed by the research.",

Section 50 should clarify the position of museums vis a vis the archiving exceptions. Of those participants who had heard of the archiving exceptions, most believed that they do not apply to museums.\n\n2. Amend section 55 (3) to:\n*  permit the making of multiple digital copies of all items in a CHI\u2019s collection, apart from those items regarding which the copyright owner has clearly stated in writing that the item is not to be digitised.\n* require CHIs to remove any item from their website upon request from its copyright owner. No damages should be payable to a copyright owner in any such case apart from where the CHI unreasonably refuses to take down an item.\n* require CHIs to consult with M\u0101ori before digitising and providing online public accessibility to cultural heritage originating from M\u0101ori. An assessment of the balance between the public interest in culture versus the owners\u2019 rights in their property should also be required.\n\n3. Section 55(3) (a)-(d) should be repealed. In a digital environment each of these requirements is meaningless. Furthermore these requirements bear no relation to the practices and policy objectives of CHIs.\n\n4. New s 55A should be inserted to permit format shifting of archival copies by CHIs.\nThis will alleviate the ongoing problem of obsolescence of computer platforms, programming languages and hardware and will ensure that archives of cultural heritage works remain accessible.\n\n5. Section 56A (1)(d) should be repealed. There is no logical reason to limit the numbers of users who can access a lawfully made digital copy of a work in a CHI\u2019s collection at any one time.\n\n6. Orphan works provisions for CHIs are urgently required and will be achieved by the proposed amendments to s 55(3) above. Given the resourcing constraints of CHIs, compulsory licensing should not be a prior requirement for CHIs to digitise orphan works.\n\nFinally, it is noted that The Guide to Copyright, currently produced by Te Papa Services, will be more useful for other CHIs if drawn up by a (named) lawyer who can assert its accuracy and has professional indemnity insurance should any errors in their advice subsequently come to light.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the digital libraries initiative, the Commission has pointed out that the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural content require appropriate measures when dealing with orphan works i.e. material still in-copyright but whose right holders cannot be identified or located. In the recently released Communications \"Europeana \u2013 next steps\"  and \"Copyright in the knowledge economy\"  the Commission indicates that it will examine the orphan works problem in an impact assessment, which will explore a variety of approaches to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of such works.\n\nIt is hard to establish reliable figures on the amount of orphan works, because at the moment there is no easy way to establish that a work is orphan. Hence, very little systematic research has been done and hardly any empirical data has been available about problems related to orphan works. The orphan works issue has been extensively analysed by the Copyright Subgroup within the High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries, appointed by the Commission in 2006. A consolidated Final Report was published in December 2009.\n\nTherefore, as a complement to the past work and in order to gather as much empirical evidence as possible on orphan works in terms of 1) the dimension of the problem and 2) of the time and resources involved in efforts for clearing rights, the Commission carried out a fact finding mission in December 2009. A request for information was sent to 17 representatives of cultural institutions who had previously been involved with digitisation of cultural materials (such as British Library, Institut National de l'Audiovisuel and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). The letter was also distributed via mailing lists of library organisations such as the LIBER and CENL. Attached to this assessment is a list of the recipients. All together the Commission received 22 responses. Several of them included comprehensive tables and statistics about key issues reflecting the above questions and a description of concrete situations. Considering the difficulties in demonstrating the dimension of orphan works in concrete figures within digitisation projects around Europe, the received materials have been useful to illustrate the difficulties faced by cultural institutions when trying to clear the rights involved in the digitisation and online accessibility of protected content in their collections, particularly orphan works.\n\nThis analysis gathers the experiences of this fact finding mission as well as the figures included in other governmental fact finding initiatives, such as the US Report on Orphan Works and the Gower's Review, both of 2006, and the more recent Digital Britain, \u00a9 The way ahead and In from the Cold reports, all of 2009. The results of the ACE Study (European Film Archives association) of 2010 about the amount of orphan works in film archives across Europe is also reflected in this paper. The status of national initiatives regarding solutions to the orphan works issue in various Member States was examined in February 2008. Some EU countries had already taken steps to develop a specific solution for the orphan works issue. The most advanced in this area are Denmark and Hungary. Denmark had chosen to strengthen their system of extended collective licences widely applied also in the rest of the Nordic countries, while Hungary opted for a centrally-granted non-exclusive licence solution. In addition, several Member States such as the UK, Germany and France are considering solutions varying from limitations to the exclusive rights of the authors, to the use of mandatory collective licensing, or so called extended collective licensing.\nIn order to solve this issue in a coherent way for all the EU, steps to propose legislation in this field need to be taken urgently.",

The authors believe that there are still some unresolved legal issues, but conservatism in interpreting the law is probably wise, and getting indemnity insurance in case something goes wrong is vital. This may be a cost on the project, but those working in large institutions may find that the institution's insurers will be prepared to apply coverage from existing policies. In the case of the authors of the study, they satisfied the University's insurers that they were taking all reasonable steps to apply the proper processes. The key points were a) the risks were low because they were doing things properly and there was a lot of goodwill on the part of the rights holders to their aims and b) there was never any question that someone could lose revenue from what they were doing as these are materials of no monetary value.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the practices of Canadian repositories in making their archival holdings available on the Internet to see whether they are more or less restrictive than copyright law requires. The Internet provides an opportunity to make archival material more widely accessible; however, repositories\u2019 copyright practices in making their holdings available online may affect the extent to which wider access to archival material is actually achieved. The study employed four different sources of evidence, i.e., the website content of 154 Canadian repositories whose websites feature archival material from the repository\u2019s holdings; copyright\npolicy and procedure documents of those repositories; 106 responses to a questionnaire sent to the staff of those repositories; and 22 interviews with repository staff members. In terms of selection for online access, the study found that the repositories studied prefer to select items that are perceived to incur little risk of copyright infringement (because the copyright has expired or because the repository owns the copyright), or items that require few or no resources to investigate copyright status or obtain copyright authorizations. Thus, with regard to selection, repositories were more restrictive than the law required, largely due to lack of resources.\nAlthough repositories have no legal or professional obligation to enforce others\u2019 copyright interests, they nonetheless attempt to control further uses of their online holdings through the use of technical measures (e.g., low resolution images, watermarks, etc.) or non-technical measures (e.g., conditions placed on further uses), for reasons not necessarily related to copyright. Overall, the study found that repositories\u2019 practices in making their holding available online were more restrictive than copyright law envisages. While this may be due to factors other than copyright, access to online documentary heritage may be limited as a result.",

There is some evidence that the \u201cbest\u201d documents are not being selected for Internet access because repositories lack the resources needed to identify and obtain the necessary authorizations, or because repositories interpret copyright conservatively. In terms of further uses of online archival holdings, archival repositories, consistent with their onsite practices, want to control further uses of their online holdings in a \u201cquasicopyright-like\u201d way. However, there is also evidence that much of the perceived copyright \u201cproblem\u201d lies in copyright law itself, because of its complexity and because repositories lack reliable up-to-date tools and resources to assist them in administering copyright.

The research examined their knowledge of national and international copyright issues as well as copyright policies at an institutional level. The survey also explored the need for copyright education for new and existing professionals and suggested topics for inclusion in training activities. The findings suggest that levels of knowledge amongst UK professionals are higher than those in other countries who participated in the first phase of the project. UK institutions are also more likely to have a copyright policy and an individual with responsibility for copyright.

The main issues discussed are the impact of selection on access, the preservation of original material and digital objects, and the financial issues surrounding digitization projects. The article does not deal with the technical aspects of digitization. A questionnaire survey was conducted of 20 UK public libraries and archives to determine their experiences related to the above issues. It was found that few digitization projects realized their full potential in terms of preserving original material, and so little has been done to ensure the preservation of the digitized material. Although access is significantly increased, the range of material that has been digitized is very narrow and is driven largely by copyright restrictions rather than user demand. The survey also highlighted the disparity between funding for access to a very small portion of library holdings through digitization, and the funding of traditional preservation for the remainder of collections.",

Libraries and archives must budget for the whole life cycle of the digitization process and not just for image capture.\nThe survey has shown that following digitization, demand for access to original material does not necessarily\ndecline. Libraries and archives should consider automatically placing restrictions on access to original materials where appropriate. This would improve preservation at little cost to the beleaguered budgets identified by many respondents, and would be consistent with using preservation as a selection criterion.\nUntil a formal preservation policy is in place, any attempt to raise significant funding for preservation activities is unlikely to succeed. Having a preservation policy is now a common requisite for the consideration of applications by funding bodies.\nDigitization should be included in that policy, even if no projects are currently planned. It will help increase awareness of digital preservation issues and will highlight the preservation aspects of digitization, rather than those that exclusively concern access.\nResearch is needed into how strategies for acquiring and preserving digital material can be developed specifically for the public library sector as a whole. Without this it is likely that strategy development will be slow and unco-ordinated.\nThere is also a need for research into robust models of the costs of digitization that take into account preservation issues.",

The survey highlighted just how little is spent on\npreservation in many libraries and archives and that typically preservation needs are seen as much larger than budgets can cater for.\nAlthough the data on financial issues was far from comprehensive, this in itself tends to indicate a general lack of awareness concerning project costs. However, having allowed for the incomplete nature of the data, two points are tentatively made. The impact of major grant\nfunding has been to virtually halt digitization projects in public libraries and archives during the last two years, and the majority of digitization projects have generated no significant\nrevenue.\nThe widespread promotion of preservation (after access) as a major benefit following digitization does not appear to be widely supported by the subsequent actions in public libraries and archives. The two ways in which digitization is said to improve preservation, a fall in demand\nto see original material and the imposition of access restrictions, have not been universally seen or adopted.\nThe level of awareness that libraries and archives in general have concerning the problems of digital preservation, must have risen to some degree given their exposure to the standards in the nof-digitise programme. However, libraries and archives have been slow to adopt preservation\npolicies and none of those surveyed include digitization in their policy.\nThere is also a distinct lack of urgency in considering migration as a strategy for digital preservation. The comments of respondents indicated that this was more likely to be an issue for the IT department to consider, although the majority of libraries and archives claimed sole responsibility for the preservation of digital master files.",

The absence of a secure licensing framework is, however, a slight disadvantage with this option as far as legal certainty is concerned.\nThe option based on mutual recognition, on the other hand, could result in slightly higher operating costs for libraries, depending on whether Member States choose costly licensing systems to authorise the lawful display of orphan works. Nevertheless, the additional license substitutes for the requisite \"permission to use\" and would thus provide additional safeguards against subsequent infringement claims. Also, as long as a diligent search has been conducted, Member States can reduce operating costs by adopting rules that orphan works can be integrated into existing licensing schemes covering digital libraries.\nProperty rights are affected in the same manner by both options. Notwithstanding a prior diligent search, the orphan work is being used without the right holders' express authorisation.\nHowever, since the mutual recognition option grants Member States the possibility to establish suitable instruments to substitute for an express authorisation, The mutual recognition option is better suited to allow Member States to provide a higher level of protection for property rights.",

Works of little and/or variable commercial value but high academic and cultural significance are languishing unused. Access to an immense amount of this material, essential for education and scholarship, is consequently badly constrained, whilst scarce public sector resources are being used up on complex and unreliable \u2018due diligence\u2019 compliance. Without any kind of UK or European Union-wide legal certainty, there will remain a major risk for all users of Orphan Works. The quantity of Orphan Works and their impact is only accelerating as content is being created and digitised without adherence to any single internationally recognised standard for capturing provenance information.\nThe data and anecdotal feedback suggests that many public sector organisations are themselves unsure as to the extent of the problem, and that staff awareness and understanding are often limited.\n\nThere are also suggestions that often works are selected for digitisation based on the fact that they do not pose any copyright issues, thus creating a black hole of 20th century content. These issues stress the need for an informed and skilled public sector to deal with all the issues associated with copyright-related materials, the necessity for access to resources to deal with Orphan Works, and an informed and proportionate understanding of the nature of the risks associated with the use of these works.\n\nIt is crucial that policy makers recognise the problems that public sector bodies face in managing and providing public access online to a vast range of works in copyright (including Orphan Works), and create a suite of appropriate legislatively based solutions. Whether the answer is a UK or an international one, involving a change in practice and interpretation and/or a change in legislation, this is clearly a matter of urgency. Without these legal safeguards, the contribution of public sector content to a global digital landscape will continue to be severely curtailed and the levels of public resources to manage copyright will be unacceptable.",

If we include even a few of these extreme examples in our calculations, it appears likely that this sample of 503 organisations could represent volumes of Orphan Works well in excess of 50 million.\n\n4)Extrapolated across UK museums and galleries, the number of Orphan Works can conservatively be estimated at 25 million, although this figure is likely to be much higher.\n\n5)The extent of Orphan Works across the public sector and their potential impact is huge. On average, 89% of participants\u2019 service delivery is at least occasionally affected, whilst 26% noted that the issue of Orphan Works either frequently affects them or affects everything that they do.\n\n6)The types of works likely to be Orphan Works are those with little commercial value, but high academic and cultural significance and where rights holders, if traced, would usually be happy for their works to be reproduced. User generated content, works by amateur or local artists and works by artists using aliases were also mentioned as at risk of being Orphan Works.\n\n7)A number of factors were identified as leading to Orphan Works, including: \n\u2212\u2212 Insufficient information identifying the copyright owner\n\u2212\u2212 The owner of the copyright could not be located\n\u2212\u2212 The copyright holder has died and there is no further information about ownership of the rights\n\n8)Overall, the most common method for managing Orphan Works is the adoption of a risk managed approach (average of 60%), whilst 4% of respondents gave \u2018other reasons\u2019. Differences in how organisations might handle Orphan Works occur between sectors.\n\n9)Organisations spent on average less than half of one day tracing rights for each Orphan Work. Therefore it would take in the region of 6 million days effort to trace the rights holders for the 13 million works represented in our on-line survey. In certain high profile projects, some organisations had spent large resources of time on chasing rights holders. However time and additional resources are also being used to educate the public and students and train (and remind) colleagues about the specifications of working with Orphan Works.\n\n10)At least 35% of organisations across all sectors, regardless of the size of their collections, do not have any specific resources in place to help deal with Orphan Works. It should be noted that responses from non-UK based respondents broadly corroborated the findings across sectoral divides, apart from how organisations handle Orphan Works, which varied between the UK and the international responses.",

Forty-two per cent had downloaded content, and 57% had streamed or accessed content. The streaming activity has grown significantly from previous waves. This is the highest level of streaming or accessing content online we have seen to date. \n\n* Consumption varied across content types; music (35%) and TV programmes (34%) had the highest levels either downloaded or streamed online in the past three months, followed by films (22%), books (12%), computer software (12%) and video games (12%). The overall consumption level has risen from the previous wave, mainly driven by the growth in the film category.\n\n* Over half (56%) of those who consumed any type of content during the past three months, paid for at least some of it. This remains stable, with no change in paid and free consumption of content from the past wave (W4).\n\n* Just over a quarter (27%) of 12+ UK internet users accessed content entirely for free, this proportion has increased slightly from Wave 4 (25%) but not significantly.\n\n* These increases reflect slightly higher consumption levels during W5 compared to W4, and a stable proportion of 12+ UK internet users consuming a mix of paid and free content (23% in W4 and 24% in W5).\n\n* In terms of those who accessed individual content types, there was a small but significant decrease in the proportion who watched online TV programmes for free from 93% during W4, to 87% in W5. This is driven by an increase in those who paid for all content from 7% in wave 4 to 15% in wave 5.\n\n* 18% (equating to approximately 7.8 million) of UK internet users aged 12+ consumed at least one item of online content illegally over the three-month period March-May 2015. And 6% of the 12+ UK internet users have exclusively consumed illegal content. There have been no significant changes in this proportion since W4.\n\n* Levels of infringement varied significantly by content type; 9% consumed at least some music illegally over the three-month period, while 7% did so for TV programmes and 6% for films. For computer software, video games and ebooks these figures were 2%, 2% and 1%, respectively.\n\n* If instead of looking at \u2018all internet users aged 12+\u2019 we use a base of \u2018all internet users who consumed content online over the three-month period\u2019, we found that 31% consumed at least one item illegally. Furthermore, 25% of those who consumed film, and 26% of those who consumed music, did so illegally, while the lowest incidence of illegal consumption was among online book consumers (10%).\n\n* The proportion of all internet users aged 12+ who consumed content exclusively legally  has decreased slightly for this wave from W4 from 40% in W4 to 39% in W5",

Copyright is frequently noted as a significant obstacle to these efforts, but little empirical data exist on the copyright permissions process in archives. This article reports the findings of a study of the copyright permissions process for the Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection at the University of Michigan. Specifically, the study sought to reveal how much effort is required to seek copyright permissions, what the results of those efforts would be, and whether or not there were traits of documents or copyright holders that were associated with accept or denial status. The study found that significant time is required to contact and negotiate with rights holders and that the biggest obstacle to getting permission is non-response. Of those requests that get a response, the vast majority are to grant permission. While few of the requests were met with denial, the data suggest that commercial copyright holders are much more likely to deny permission than other types of copyright holders. The data also show that adherence to the common policy of only displaying online those documents with explicit permission will likely result in substantially incomplete online collections.",

      "abstract": "Over the past several years, policy makers and private actors have developed an evolving set of approaches for addressing the orphan works problem \u2014 a problem that arises when \u201cthe owner of a copyrighted work cannot be identified and located by someone who wishes to make use of the work in a manner that requires permission of the copyright owner,\u201d preventing follow-on uses of works. These approaches usually attempt to address the orphan works problem by employing some threshold mechanism to differentiate true orphan works, to which the proposed solutions would apply, from non-orphaned copyrighted works. Satisfying a \u201creasonably diligent search\u201d is one well-known formulation by which users can designate works as orphaned and therefore subject to a proposed solution, though \u2014 as this paper points out \u2014 alternative approaches certainly exist. Regardless of the specific formulation, the search for rightsholders (or conversely, the confirmation that no rightsholder can be located) is an integral component of almost every orphan works proposal. This paper examines in detail the core schemes for identifying rightsholders among the leading orphan works regimes and proposals. Although these schemes differ across many variables, three factors predominate: (1) who is expected to participate in the search process, (2) the nature and extent of the required search generally; and (3) specifically what types of resources, tools, registries or other information-sharing mechanisms are required or allowed. This paper compares existing proposals\u2019 approaches with respect to the first factor: who participates in a search? A subsequent paper will focus on the second and third factors.",

Of these:\n* rightsholders gave permission for just 17% of the books to be digitised;\n* permission was not granted for 26% of the titles;\n* for 26% of the titles no response was received;\n* rightsholder contact details for the remaining 31% of the titles could not be located.\n\n8 On average it took 4 hours per book to undertake a \u201cdiligent search\u201d. This involved clarifying the copyright status of the work and then identifying rightsholders and requesting permissions.\n\n9 In contrast the use of the ARROW system took less than 5 minutes per title to upload the catalogue records and check the results.\n\n10 During the study the diligent search and the ARROW system identified the same copyright status for 51% of titles. System improvements made soon after the study closure subsequently brought this figure to 69%. A comparison of the ultimate rights clearance outcome of the works queried via each process showed that in 92% of cases the same result was received.",

The definition of what online use of the works could be freely available and free of charge in order to promote education and research;\n2.

Provide for a limitation or exception intended to facilitate, in certain cases, the digitization of works and productions for their use in virtual education;\n2.

      "intervention_response": "* Mass-Digitisation is an industrial process, and hence is very susceptible to efficiency gains at scale. Broadly, the larger a Digitisation project becomes, the lower the unit cost of Digitisation due to the dispersal of overhead and upfront capital costs over a larger body of material.\n* Digitisation naturally tends towards greater efficiency over time. Hence the work-rate of a Digitisation facility at the start of a 10-year project is significantly lower than towards the end. This is not only due to the increased technical competence of the people involved, but also the gradual refinement and streamlining of workflow over the period of the project. This effect has been noted even in 3-year projects, with a significant majority of the Digitisation completed during the project lifetime being completed in the 3rd year.\n\n* Due to natural market forces and the increasing presence of low-cost, high-volume Digitisation services in India and the Far East, the unit cost of Digitisation provided by 3rd party services has decreased significantly over the past 10 years.\n\n* The Return on Investment in large-scale Digitisation tends to be higher where there is ongoing strategic investment in Digitisation as a core activity of the cultural institution, rather than as a project-funded activity. This is due to the significant efficiency gain that arises from long-term practice and the development of tacit institutional knowledge and expertise leading to more effective prioritisation and decision-making.\n\n* As with physical collections, the acquisition of digital material creates a long-term obligation on the host institution, which must be accounted for. Most estimates put the cost of preserving and providing access to a digital asset for a period of 10 years at 50-100% of the initial costs of creating it. Hence, mass-Digitisation creates a large-scale economic obligation which must be addressed from the outset in programme budgets. \n\n* When considering mass-Digitisation and text-conversion/encoding of books, it is important to factor into the value equation not only the potential value of the assets themselves, but also the considerable value of the new knowledge and information associated with them (such as the new insight into language development gained by Google as a result of the Google Book Search project).",

The circumstances and level of compensation are to be decided by the law of the Member State in which the institution using the work is established. The non-commercial nature of the use, the public interest mission of the institution and the possible harm to rightholders will be taken into account in determining the amount (Recital 18). The Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC states that in situations where prejudice to the rightholder is likely to be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise (Recital 35). Compensation for the use of orphan works should follow the same principle, especially those that have not been in economic use for decades. In addition, a re-appearing rightholder must be able to demonstrate beyond doubt their right to the work, and the extent of their right (which may be shared with other rightholders who remain untraced). \n\n*Member States should follow the principle of the InfoSoc Directive and allow that a fair compensation may equal zero compensation in certain circumstances. \n\n* Member States should ensure in cases when a rightholder comes forward to claim their rights in a work that a proper system is in place for establishing the validity of their claim. \n\n*Unpublished works must be available for consultation in a Knowledge and Cultural Heritage Institution with the consent of the rightholder. An example would be the private diary of a life during wartime, written by a person whose son or daughter, having become the rightholder, gives it to a library after the death of the author, so that it can be consulted by researchers. This work will be an orphan work if the library cannot subsequently find the son or daughter, or cannot find the person who inherits their rights after they have died. The category \u201cunpublished works\u201d in the Directive therefore is very limited. Member States in addition can choose to exclude all unpublished works from the scope of the Directive if they are given to the library after 29 October 2014. Removal of another category of orphan work would have a negative impact on public access to historical and cultural materials, and it would add to the administrative burden of handling orphan works.  \n\n* Member States should not limit the application of Article 1.3 to works deposited with libraries before 29 October 2014.\n\n*Recognizing the growing problem of orphan works in the dissemination of Europe\u2019s cultural heritage, the European Union decided to legislate to permit the use of orphan works in special circumstances. Ideally, the Directive would enable libraries to undertake large-scale digitization of interesting works whose rightholders cannot be traced, and make the works available on the public internet for educational and cultural purposes.",

For example: children\u2019s storybooks that become oldfashioned; out-of-date political analysis of events; manuals for working people when the kind of work has changed, such as a handbook written in 1920 for domestic servants. \n  \n*Even where orphan works provide valuable resources for scholarship, the transaction costs involved in obtaining permission may be too high, or the risks of litigation too great for the library to undertake the task.

      "abstract": "Digital and web-based information technology and media give the public new possibilities of exploiting cultural material. Works existing in analogue form can now be easily digitised and therefore reused for different purposes and by different users. Industries, such as publishers, producers, broadcasters or information service providers are taking advantage of information technology by reusing analogue material in different ways. For instance, analogue material can be republished on the Internet websites, released on DVD or new compilations of old material can be produced. Also different cultural institutions can take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by digital technology. Museums, archives and libraries are involved in the digitisation of their collections of cultural and scientific material. In the case of the activities carried out by cultural institutions, the purpose of digitisation is often not only to preserve cultural and scientific material but also to provide users with access to their resources, including access online. To promote digitisation, online accessibility and preservation of digital material of cultural institutions, the European Commission launched the \"i2010: Digital Libraries\" programme1 in September 2005. Before digitising and further reutilising material that is still in copyright, the prospective user must often obtain consent from the copyright owner. The problem appears when it is impossible to find or locate right holders or when right holders remain unknown. This is the problem of so called \u2018orphan works\u2019. Where it is impossible to get suitable permission from the owner, digitisation and further exploitation of the material might not take place. Such a situation is to the detriment not only of the user, but generally speaking, of the public, as no-one profits from cultural material left unexploited due to its orphan status.   Discussions on how to deal with orphan works are currently being undertaken by stakeholders and cultural and collective management institutions at different levels and scopes. Some of them have been initiated by the stakeholders themselves, others by the European Commission or by Member States. Generally speaking, the aim of these discussions is to find a solution to facilitate the use of orphan material without prejudice to copyright. The eventual solution should provide legal certainty both to users and right holders, should the right holders reappear after the use of orphan works was made without their explicit consent.   The objective of this report is to give a general overview of the situation of orphan works in the European Union. The report describes possible legislative solutions to the issue, as well as main actions that are currently underway in this field.",

It is therefore essential that mechanisms adopted by Member States are interoperable and that there is a system of mutual recognition of adopted solutions between countries. In the case where Member States do not foresee to undertake any steps to create a mechanism for use of orphan works, it would not be possible to achieve interoperability within the EU. In such a situation it would be necessary to implement a mechanism enabling the use of orphan works at European level. This would require undertaking other actions in order to harmonise national solutions and provide Member States with a suitable mechanism for the use of orphan works.",

      "proposition": "*The system of extended collective licensing is not specifically tailored to orphan works but as its application is general, it can cover the problem of orphan works as well. The system applies automatically to all right holders in a given field, even unknown or untraceable. However in Europe, the ECL system functions only in few countries on a large scale. Although the Copyright Directive does not contain any provisions in relation to neither orphan works nor the management of rights, point 18 of its Preamble provides that the Directive remains without prejudice to any arrangements of Member States concerning management of rights, such as extended collective licensing.  \n\n*A model based on a non-exclusive licence is different as it requires the active role of an independent body which has the power to issue a non-exclusive licence. This system requires providing diligent search for the right holders prior to the use of orphan works and paying a fee. In the European Union only the UK law foresees the possibility of issuing a nonexclusive licence but the system has a relatively narrow scope. The UK Copyright Tribunal can issue consent for use of orphan works only in relation to sound recordings. On a large scale this system so far only applies in Canada. The Hungarian provisions that foresee a similar system are still under the form of proposal. It seems also, that Member States can legally introduce provisions establishing a mechanism of issuing a non-exclusive licence by an administrative or public body without prejudice to the Copyright Directive. \n\n*The third option, a model based on limitation or exception to copyrights, does not function for the moment in any legislation. The concept however, is similar to the \u2018Canadian model\u2019 in the sense that the user has to provide the diligence search prior to use. The main difference is that as the user could use the work under an exception to copyrights, there is no administrative body to control if the search for the right holder has been diligent enough and secondly, that the fee would be payable only after the reappearance of the right holder. This solution, for the moment, is not compatible however with EU legislation as the Copyright Directive does not foresee any possibility for Member States to introduce new exceptions or limitations to copyrights (the list of possible exceptions and limitations to copyrights in the Directive is exhaustive). That is why the solution of the UK would require changing the European copyright law prior to introducing a new limitation to copyright in UK legislation.  \n\n*The problem of orphan works is very complex, especially because of the cross-border aspect of digitisation and following the reuse of digital material. Still, the majority of countries in the European Union do not have any legislation concerning use of orphan works. Therefore it is essential that Member States should adopt a mechanism that will be interoperable in other countries within the EU with the \u2018mutual recognition\u2019 option.",

      "abstract": "Digital technologies have transformed libraries, archives and access to information. They have revolutionized the information landscape. \nLibraries and archives support the work of scientists and scholars, which is increasingly collaborative, interdisciplinary and global in nature. In tandem with the expanding opportunities for search and resource discovery enabled by digital technologies, there is growing demand to access materials held in libraries and archives around the world. Global library spending on print and digital content runs into billions of dollars every year \u2013 much of it taxpayer funded. In 2014 this amounted to an estimated USD25.4 billion. But faced with a maze of different copyright laws and licensing conditions, libraries and archives are finding it increasingly difficult to respond to the information needs of the public they serve. \nPreserving our documentary heritage, \u201cour memory of the world,\u201d is expensive.  To lower these costs, reduce duplication of effort and maximize reach, libraries and archives are exploring ways of using digital technologies to create shared preservation infrastructures both nationally and internationally. This is imperative within the borderless digital arena. As noted by European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip, responsible for the Digital Single Market, \u201cthe borderless nature of digital technologies means it no longer makes sense for each EU country to have its own rules for telecommunications services, copyright, data protection, or the management of radio spectrum.\u201d",

The situation is even worse for archives, with two-thirds \u2013 126 countries or 67 percent of them \u2013 not permitting archives to make copies for research or study purposes. Moreover, 89 countries (47 percent of the total surveyed) do not  explicitly allow libraries to make copies for preservation purposes; and 85 of them (45 percent of the total) do not allow archives to make such copies. \n\n*In countries where new anti-circumvention protections (technologies designed to restrict unauthorized access to protected works) have been introduced, while 52 countries have exempted libraries, around half of them have not. In practice, this means that where a technological protection measure is applied to digital content, libraries cannot circumvent it even to make use of an exception under copyright law, and therefore cannot copy the work concerned. In effect, the law is giving with one hand, and taking away with the other. \n\n*Data obtained from the British Library under a Freedom of Information request show that the number of journal titles available under the INCD service fell by 93 percent, from 330,700 titles in 2011 to 23,600 in 2012. More titles \u201cdisappeared\u201d than are available under the non-commercial licenses, and some 28,300 titles are no longer available either at commercial or non-commercial rates. \n\n* In 2011, the Library provided information to libraries in 59 countries under the copyright-based service. By 2014 under the licensed service, the number of countries served had fallen to 33. The reduction in journal titles available to non-commercial users appears to be linked to the fact that the majority of titles are now only available at commercial rates.\n\n*The number of requests the British Library was able to satisfy under its new scheme, in the first year of its service, fell by 92 percent, from 38,100 to 2,884. Whereas in 2011 the Library would have anticipated fulfilling over 100,000 requests for information during the period 2012-2104, by the end of 2014 the number had fallen to just 1,057, representing a year-onyear reduction of 97 percent. While the Library still has the documents, in many cases it is no longer able to provide them under the new licensing arrangement. In fact, in 2012 more requests for information were refused due to licensing restrictions (2,942) than were satisfied under the new licensing service (2,884).",

Given the current oligopolistic order, it is unsurprising that our 15 interviews revealed a concerted effort by multinational companies to delay and control the impact of the Internet. Rather than engaging with the development of new business models for e-commerce, the multinationals showed a defensive orientation.\n\n* Interviews at all multinationals indicated that they would \u2018follow demand, not be proactive\u2019 (CFO, multinational). Priority was given to protecting existing margins and relationships with retailers. Multinationals generally refuse to licence their catalogue to third parties, offering on-line distribution.\n\n* Despite a defensive orientation, the established music industry is unlikely to succeed in stemming the digital tide. Scenario techniques open a way to conceptualise a multichannel future beyond on-line distribution. Over two axis\u2019, supply and demand constraints for a future music industry were constructed. On the demand side, the consumers will either opt for high interactivity and a large range of choice, or less interactivity and more trusted suppliers of packages. On the supply side, the options are either a centralisation of content in the form of intellectual property rights (IPRs) controlled by few players, or decentralisation with IPR creators retaining ownership.\n\n* The music industry is entering a period of instability, which is not primarily characterised by disintermediation but changing patterns of intermeditiation. The main strategic challenge to the established players appears to be that, as yet, no credible business model has emerged in the on line environment that would secure revenue streams from value-adding intermediation and, eventually, channel investments back into content production.

We find that firms active in open innovation have a strong preference for the governance of their open innovation relationships through formal contracts. These contracts are relevant from both a control and a process monitoring perspective. Also, despite the open nature of open innovation, firms still see intellectual property rights as highly relevant to the protection of their innovative capabilities. In a first attempt to explain this preference for intellectual property rights by open innovation firms, we find the degree of openness of firms, their legalistic attitude, and the competitive dynamics of their product market environment to be related to this preference.",

The perceived importance of formal contracts as a means to monitor the progress of collaboration is somewhat lower with an average score of 5.10 on a 7 point Likert scale. These different scores for the use of contracts for control or monitoring purposes turned out to be only marginally statistically significant.\n\n*Firms active in open innovation seem to have a very strong preference for (renewable) contracts to govern their relationship with their partners when they engage in joint R&D, joint product and process development, and joint design. Not using contracts is 15 very much rather the exception than the rule. Also, open innovation firms value these contracts from both a legal control perspective as well as a more practical process monitoring perspective. \n\n* These firms indicate that, without IPR, they would be less inclined to cooperate with other firms as, based on their IPR protection, they are willing to invest in innovative activities that they can share with others.  Results from our survey show a more detailed perspective on the role of IPR. It turns out that patents and technical and commercial information (trade secrets) are seen as the most important instruments to protect the innovative capabilities of firms from their open innovation partners, as indicated by nearly 90% of the firms in our sample. Trademarks and design rights are also seen as relevant by a substantial share of firms (nearly 75% and over 65%, respectively). Given the industry breakdown of the firms in our sample, it is probably not surprising that a smaller share of firms (about 53%) see the relevance of copyrights for the protection of their innovative capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Every IP right has its own definition of infringement. In this paper, we suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for evaluating IP infringement. The fact that patent law focuses on an expert audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many of the differences in how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s works. Consumers, by contrast, are likely to pay more attention to market substitution and less attention to how things work under the hood. Understanding the different audiences in IP infringement is critical to understanding how the IP regimes define infringement.",

Many of the problems in IP law come from decisions that neglect one aspect or the other. Thus, \u201cthe audience\u201d in IP infringement is properly a hybrid: a domain expert who can assess similarity and a consumer who can assess substitutability. Copyright law has internalized this lesson, albeit imperfectly. Patent, trademark, and design patent laws can all learn from its example.",

      "proposition": "*There are some technological areas in which patent law does not in practice heed its general rule of choosing the expert as audience. The most notable example involves software patents. In this area, because the Federal Circuit allows software to be claimed based on its function rather than on its more detailed technical workings, infringement can be found when two computer programs serve the same function, even if the software works in very different ways.81 A consumer or ordinary reasonable observer might use the purpose the software serves to assess similarity more generally, but a software expert would not.With few exceptions, then, the expert is the audience for patent infringement. For this audience choice to work, the fact finder must be able to put herself in the position of the expert. Patent law tries to address this challenge by relying on expert witnesses to explain the technology while limiting the amount of post hoc expert testimony on the meaning of patent claims and relying instead on documentary materials in existence at the time of patent filing. Patent law also gives the judge the role of assigning meaning to patent terms. Even though that job is really fact finding, not legal interpretation, it is arguably better suited to judges than juries because of their increased exposure to patent-infringement suits.\n\n* Copyright law\u2019s use of varied infringement audiences is confused and often depends on the particular circuit deciding the case. As a general matter, however, copyright uses a hybrid test, drawing on both the perspective of the expert and that of a nonexpert observer (either the consumer or the ordinary person).\n\n* Patent and trademark are virtual antipodes when it comes to the audience used to assess infringement. Patent law focuses on a hypothetical audience of experts, while trademark law ostensibly cares about both actual consumers\u2019 reactions and the defendant\u2019s subjective intent. The test for infringement of a design patent draws much more from trademark than from patent law. Infringement is judged in the eye of an ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives. This test evokes an actual audience composed of reasonable purchasers, just as the trademark test does. But the audience is asked a different question. Despite the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken of \u201cthe resemblance . . . such as to deceive such an observer, inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other,\u201d the Federal Circuit has held that in design patent law, it is the similarity between the claimed design and the defendant\u2019s product, not the likelihood of confusion, that determines infringement. The result is a hybrid: the consumer audience from trademark law, asked to make the rather more abstract assessment of expert-based technical similarity from patent or copyright law. \n\n* Because consumers as a class tend to focus on whether the uses for two products are interchangeable, the consumer is likely to be the audience that most directly measures whether the plaintiff\u2019s work and the defendant\u2019s work at issue in IP litigation substitute for one another in the marketplace. When the consumer is the audience for IP infringement, then, market substitutes are more likely to be deemed infringing and thus third parties will be discouraged from producing substitutes without permission from the rights holder. For this reason, the consumer is an ideal audience choice for assessing IP infringement when that form of IP law seeks to discourage third parties from creating or distributing market substitutes of works protected by an IP right.\n\n* Different audiences (and fact finders, for that matter) can readily provide varying determinations on infringement. The choice of audience therefore ought to be made carefully with regard to the desired goals of each form of IP law. Understanding this fact helps explain many of the differences in IP infringement doctrine.",

      "proposition": "* New IP is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if a video game is based on a new IP and 0 otherwise. 29% of all video games in the sample are based on new IP. Thee statistic corresponds with generally accepted statistics of non-imitative or really new innovations in a market. Figure 3.2 displays the distribution of video game introductions per platform and the ratio of new IP introductions by platform maturity. The figure illustrates that, across different levels of platform maturity, there is sufficient variance in terms of the number of games entering each platform as well as the ratio of video games that are based on new intellectual property.\n\n* There exists a concave curvilinear effect of platform maturity on complement sales. As the number of late platform adopters increases, the positive effect of indirect network effects is mitigated by differences in late adopters\u2019 characteristics and behavior. Moreover, these differences do not affect all types of complements equally. First, late adopters increasingly shy away from choosing innovative complements in favor of non-novel ones. Platform maturity thus amplifies the sales disparity between innovative and non-novel complements. Secondly, late adopters increasingly congregate around superstar complements amplifying the skewness between popular and less popular complements on the platform. \n\n* Two auxiliary findings are that there exist positive indirect network effects and negative same side network effects in the market for console video games. An additional game entering the platform has a negative effect on cumulative unit sales for games launched in the subsequent month. The latter result adds support to the \u201ccompetitive crowding\u201d hypothesis of direct network effects for complements in platform markets (Boudreau, 2012; Wareham et al., 2014). The finding is consistent with Venkatraman and Lee (2004) who conclude that video game developers are less likely to enter crowded video game platforms. Additionally, the finding aligns with Boudreau et al. (2011) who find that the effect of adding competitors in the context of innovation contest platforms is contingent on the uncertainty and nature of the challenge. In a split-sample analysis comparing innovative with less novel games, the author found that the negative effect of competitive crowding is stronger for innovative games.",

      "abstract": "Illegal filesharing on the internet leads to considerable financial losses for artists and copyright owners as well as producers and sellers of music. Thus far, measures to contain this phenomenon have been rather restrictive. However, there are still a considerable number of illegal systems, and users are able to decide quite freely between legal and illegal downloads because the latter are still difficult to sanction. Recent economic approaches account for the improved bargaining position of users. They are based on the idea of revenue-splitting between professional sellers and peers. In order to test such an innovative business model, the study reported in this article carried out an experiment with 100 undergraduate students, forming five small peer-to-peer networks. The networks were confronted with different economic conditions. The results indicate that even experienced filesharers hold favourable attitudes towards revenue-splitting.

Further experimental research might consider factors such as unlimited time,a larger number of participants,the integration of chatrooms,new ways of distribution (including cellphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs)),real budgets and real songs.While the participants more or less behaved according to the theoretical idea in a 30-minute simulation period,long-term online experiments might clarify whether or not some users drop out of the system because they are never addressed, while other users emerge as new big players within the system.

Furthermore, streaming does have a positive impact on live music attendance, as expected, but only on concerts by national or international stars. Hence, unlike file-sharing, streaming turns out to have no impact on physical recorded music sales but like file-sharing, streaming is complementary with attending concerts by national or international stars. The recursive model enables the authors to bring to light the indirect effect of explanatory variables on the attendance of concerts by international and national stars. For instance, the taste for music and the recommendation of friends exhibit both direct and indirect effects on concert attendance. Being young, an intensive Internet user and using the web to get information and advice on music all favour the practice of streaming and indirectly play a role in concert attendance. Conversely, being male and earning a large income only affect the INTER variable.\n\n* Results concerning socio-economic variables are as expected. Individuals between 40 and 59 years-old buy more CDs. Age is also a strong determinant of attendance of classical concerts. Income and education are positively correlated with music consumption. Internet users in large cities have a higher probability of going to concerts of classical music or by local artists, which can be explained by the availability of these concerts in bigger cities. More surprising is the negative relationship between the local population size and the consumption of CDs in conventional offline retailers. One explanation might be that since access to live music is more difficult in less densely populated areas, the best way to obtain access to music content is to buy physical goods. It is also noted that the variable controlling for regional specificity also seems to capture a singularity for respondents from Brittany.\n\n* The results support two major findings concerning the impact of streaming on music consumption. First, streaming has no effect on offline music sales. Second, streaming has a positive effect on attendance of concerts by national and international stars but not on concerts of classical music or by local artists.",

      "abstract": "At least three distinct aspects can be identified and each raises a series of questions as to the role of creativity in contemporary Australian life.\n* Creative work:  Significant numbers of people work in jobs that involve the exercise of creative skills. Is it possible to identify a creative workforce and to assess its contribution to the Australian economy? And are these workers employed in sectors of the economy that could be thought of as the creative industries? \n* Creative class:  A lot of attention has been focused recently on the proposition that creative people tend to cluster in particular urban environments, stimulating economic growth and social interaction. Such people have been referred to as a \u2018creative class\u2019. Does this concept have any relevance to cities in Australia? And can we describe any of the State or Territory capitals as a \u2018creative city\u2019? \n* Creative participation:  Australians spend their leisure time in a variety of ways, many of which could be referred to as creative. Active involvement in the arts, through painting, singing, playing a musical instrument, writing, dancing and so on all involve the development and application of creative skills. Moreover, participation in the arts as a consumer\u2014visiting art galleries, reading novels, going to the theatre\u2014all involve a form of creative engagement. How important are such activities in Australian life today?\n\nThis paper addresses all three of these aspects of creativity in Australian society at the present time. The central proposition to be explored is that the somewhat vague idea of Creative Australia can indeed be given conceptual and empirical substance, thanks particularly to the rich sources of data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Quite a lot is already known about many statistical aspects of the arts and culture in Australia as a result of the longstanding efforts of the Statistics Working Group of the Cultural Ministers\u2019 Council and the dedicated work of the National Centre for Culture and Recreation Statistics of the ABS located in Adelaide. But in addition to these sources, access to the Census results provides a unique opportunity to shed light on aspects of our topic that can only be effectively studied using data collected under the rigorous methodology and comprehensive coverage of the Australian Census",

      "proposition": "* In looking at the characteristics of the creative workforce in Australia, we can ask whether the numbers of creative workers have grown over the last ten years. Comparative data from the 1996, 2001 and 2006 Censuses can be used to examine changes over this period. These data indicate that the size of the creative workforce as defined above grew by almost 40 per cent in the period 1996\u20132006, a compound growth rate of about 3 per cent per annum. The growth was particularly spurred by increases in numbers in the design professions, which grew at an annual rate of about 6 per cent. The growth in the creative workforce is reflective of structural changes that have been occurring in the economy in recent years, as traditional manufacturing and service industries gradually give way to information and knowledge-based industries in the socalled new economy. Technological changes in communications and information processing have contributed significantly to these shifts, and the consequences can be observed in employment levels. For example, the increase in numbers in the design professions noted above can be contrasted with the decline in more traditional areas such as printing; the numbers of printing tradespeople have fallen by 25 per cent over the last decade.   \n\n* In regard to the importance of creativity in economic life, the author has noted the growing interest in the world at large in the emerging concept of the creative economy, centred on the creative or cultural industries. Australia has experienced somewhat the same patterns of growth in its creative sector as have other countries, when observed in terms of contribution to GDP or to employment. To some extent this has happened without significant policy intervention, at least at the Federal level; the grand 1990s vision of Creative Nation was not pursued by the Commonwealth Government after 1996, and initiatives to promote cultural industry development over the last decade have mainly arisen at State level, as a component of urban and regional policy\u2014in particular the rhetoric of \u2018creative cities\u2019 has been enthusiastically espoused around the country, and this shows no signs of abating. Thus although Australia may not unequivocally be described as a creative economy at the present time, there are certainly elements in the system which are pointing in that direction. But a stronger policy involvement, especially at the Federal level, is likely to be needed in the future if Australia is to maintain or enhance its established and emerging strengths in the development of creative skills across the economy at large. \n\n*The core components of the country\u2019s cultural sector\u2014the creative artists, the performing companies, the galleries, museums and libraries, the heritage sites, and the public broadcasting system\u2014are all well-established. Despite periodic fluctuations across the political cycle, bipartisan support for public funding provided for cultural purposes by Federal, State and local governments remains reasonably stable.51 Nevertheless the per capita levels of such funding are by no means generous in comparison with other countries of comparable wealth. \n\n*This project provides a vivid illustration of the value of the Census in shedding light on aspects of contemporary Australian society. Census data, of course, have the enormous advantage of comprehensiveness and accuracy, avoiding the problems of sampling bias and difficulties of statistical inference that characterise the use of data derived from surveys. In the present project the identification of the creative workforce has been a central task, made possible by the fact that the Census provides labour market data to a high degree of occupational specificity, together with industry definitions that enable the clear delineation of the cultural sector of the economy. In addition, the ability to trace locational aspects to the finest level of disaggregation has allowed the testing of hypotheses concerning the existence of so-called creative cities in various parts of the country. Future Censuses are likely to be even more useful in their application to analysis of the cultural sector if the revised framework for cultural statistics currently being developed at an international level is finally agreed upon and adopted in Australia.",

The changing face of copyright requires a re-evaluation of the existing norms and theories of copyright as an inanimate phenomenon that is reliant on humans for its adaptations. This article examines authors\u2019 responses to these developments in the context of the philosophical theories underpinning copyright law, current Australian legislative and judicial considerations, and the impact of e-publishing on traditional perceptions of copyright protection. In particular, the article incorporates findings from a research study conducted with Australian authors on their perceptions of the value and meaning of copyright and how these viewpoints affect their creative practice, as well as their ability to deal with digital copyright challenges and publishing opportunities. In taking cognisance of these research results and considering the concurrent evolution of digital copyright models, this article proposes that there is a need to address the tension exhibited between the utilitarian approach, characteristic of Australian copyright law, and the natural rights views of authors, to create a sustainable balance.",

This figure rose to almost 90 per cent in relation to the following statement: \u2018Copyright is a consideration for me when I publish my work\u2019. These responses suggest that most respondents regarded copyright as an important consideration in the publishing process, rather than during the creative process, possibly due to the immediacy of having to deal with this issue in publishing contracts and royalty considerations.\n\n* During the in-depth interviews, the responses appeared to support those generated by the online survey but also further revealed the relationship between authors\u2019 perceptions of copyright and creative expression. Eleven of the interviewees expressed the view that they did not regard copyright as an incentive to create and perceived it as having minimal or no influence in their approach to their work, whereas five respondents said it was an important consideration in their practice. However, five of the negative respondents qualified their answers by adding that, although copyright did not motivate them to write, it was an important issue to be considered once they had created the work. These respondents were emphatic in their viewpoint that copyright afforded them no creative motivation, some authors even expressing surprise at the suggestion. \n\n* Both groups - over 90 per cent of respondents - overwhelmingly agreed that they were \u2018mostly motivated by personal satisfaction.\u2019 However, nearly 46 per cent also agreed that they were \u2018mostly motivated by achieving recognition\u2019, indicating that there was some overlap in their purpose, with some respondents being equally motivated by personal satisfaction and achieving recognition. A variation in the fulltime and part-time group responses was however evident in relation to financial incentives.

Thus, in cases where the latter represent critical core knowledge, managers should be cautious when it comes to buying external R&D. At the same time, this suggests that managers can at least partly in\ufb02uence the imitation risk by contracting out more speci\ufb01c tasks, that are less easy to transfer into a di\ufb00erent commercial context. On that note it may also pay out to de\ufb01ne con\ntractual terms which help to \u2018arti\ufb01cially\u2019 increase speci\ufb01city. However, sometimes the bene\ufb01ts\nof R&D outsourcing may still prevail. When we think of products as modular combinations\nof early stage R&D, a \ufb01rm might pro\ufb01t from external contributors (although under risk of\nloosing control over early stage IP) and simultaneously be able to secure its competitive ad\nvantage on the \ufb01nal product market. Clearly specifying the allocation of property rights is not\nonly useful to align incentives, resulting in higher innovation e\ufb00orts of the vendor (Arora and\nMerges, 2004; Leiponen, 2008), but also reduces the infringement risk. This will be especially\nvaluable for \ufb01rms that operate in sectors that have limited access to formal measures of IP\nprotection.",

That is, 7.52 percent indicate that they exclusively publish IP articles, and another 8.89 percent indicated that they frequently publish IP articles. An overwhelming proportion of journals in the sample indicated that they do publish IP articles but only occasionally (32.61 percent) or rarely (34.78 percent). A significant proportion indicated that they do not publish IP articles (16.30 percent).\n\n*The sample contains a substantial majority of journals who make their article content available online before or contemporaneous with the publication of an issue (71.43 percent), while 9.89 percent indicated that online publication was not immediate or depended on the circumstances. Last, 17.58 percent of journals in our sample indicated that their policy is not to make journal content publicly available online.\n\n* In terms general copyright practices on average, they observe that practices of journals in our sample vary greatly with regard to their copyright assignment and public dissemination policies. For instance, while most journals do not ask authors to assign copyright in their articles (48.91 percent), almost as many journals do ask authors to assign copyright in their articles (42.39 percent). Also, most journals in the sample ask authors not to publicly disseminate their article before publication: 21.98 percent of journals prohibit public dissemination before publication, 14.29 percent ask but do not require authors not to publicly disseminate articles before publication, and 21.98 percent of journals will ask authors not to publicly disseminate depending on the circumstances. However, 38.46 percent of journals responding to the survey do not ask authors not to publicly disseminate their work prior to publication. \n\n* More consensus among journals in the sample emerges around the issues of exclusive publication, republication credits, and third party republication agreements. Most journals (52.22 percent) require authors to sign an exclusive publication agreement. Only 25.56 percent of journals do not ask authors to sign exclusive publication agreements at all, while 20.00 percent do ask authors to sign exclusive publication agreements but--depending on the circumstances--do not require the author\u2019s exclusive publication agreement. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of journals (73.63 percent) require credits upon the republication of the author\u2019s article, and 10.99 percent ask authors for a republication credit but may not require it, leaving just 12.09 percent of journals that do not ask for such a credit. Finally, responses show that journals in the sample tend to grant third parties to republish or otherwise distribute the journals\u2019 articles. While most journals grant third party republication permission with a credit (43.96 percent), others require payment of a licensing fee (8.79 percent), while others yet permit third party republication without restriction (4.40 percent). A significant number of journals indicated that third party republication permission depended on the circumstances (29.67 percent), while 5.49 percent of journals do not allow third party re-publication. Finally, 7.69 percent of journals responded that they did not know whether their journal allowed third party re-publication.\n\n* The analysis suggests that legacy policies at law journals may create unnecessary barriers to open access as well as impact scholars\u2019 abilities to use certain kinds of materials in their articles. This is evidenced by the significant number of journal respondents indicating that they: (1) require copyright transfers; (2) exclusive copyright agreements; and (3) not permitting the public dissemination of articles by the author prior to publication.

A significantly higher percentage of the public domain books are still in print, with significantly more editions available per book, and for the sub-set of especially durable works, the public domain works are significantly less expensive.  Although the data show that rates of availability for both kinds of books are likely sensitive to reductions in the cost of duplication and distribution, the study concludes that protection of fiction beyond the period necessary to ensure its creation is not justified by concerns about under-exploitation.

If one considers only the sub-set of the most valuable books, then a significant difference in price can be measured, confirming economists\u2019 suspicions about deadweight losses associated with the extension of copyright protection.   The only arguable benefit to offset these losses would be the reduction of possible congestion externalities.  In the context of books (unlike trademarks and perhaps celebrity personae) where the public is never forced to overconsume the product, it seems highly unlikely that the multiplicity of editions shown in the data demonstrate any such externalities. \n\n* In general, the data show a highly competitive and robust market for the production of public domain books.  Markets for other products, such as movies, music and software, where technology has made the cost of reproduction extremely low, are likely to behave in much the same way.

On the average, the copyrighted books are ten years younger than the public domain books, which may have resulted in marginally increased demand, driving up their availability.  On the other hand, publishers of public domain books did not have to pay a licensing fee, which made those titles marginally cheaper to print.  In 2001, the availability curves disentangle and the in-print status for public domain works approaches 100% in 2004-2006.

      "abstract": "It is contentious to what extent the existing copyright system contributes to the positive development of the regulated sectors of society. The present report shows that substantially more musical works and movies have been released in recent years than before the diffusion of digital copying technology. At the same time, the average quality of these works has been stable according to user assessments. Countries with stronger copyright protection do not exhibit greater supply of new works. Accordingly, the relatively strict copyright protection in some countries does not seem to promote the supply of new creative works. The present report also considers whether user-generated content (UGC) complements or substitutes professional content. An increasing supply of valuable UGC is not reflected in official economic statistics. In all probability, copyright protection promotes user-generated content less than professional content. As a result, substituting professional content with \"amateur material\" could reduce the socially desirable strength of copyright protection. However, we find that almost half of all works available on YouTube are professional content. Professional works are watched and recommended more frequently than the average. In addition, a large proportion of UGC on YouTube draws on professional works. There is little evidence that professional content would be widely replaced.

First, data restrictions do not allow us to draw very firm conclusions. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of copyright from the impact of broader technological change with digitization.\n\n*The findings presented here show that commonly voiced assumptions have no solid basis. There is no solid evidence that the diffusion of digital copying technology fundamentally would have damaged the supply of new works. Neither does it appear that UGC will replace professional content, which would call into question the conventional economic justification for copyright.\n\n*Further empirical work is needed to strengthen the evidence\u00adbase for copyright policy.

UGC has a share of 33\u00a0percent. On average, professional content was accessed over four times more than UGC. In contrast, the average number of \u201clikes\u201d for professional content and for UGC is similarly high, so the ratio of \u201clikes\u201d to views is greater for UGC. This is perhaps not only due to the quality of the videos but also due to greater motivation to leave positive feedback for amateurs than for professionals. Overall, professional content makes up a considerable share of YouTube material. It would be an exaggeration to claim that professional content is largely being replaced. In addition, a substantial minority of UGC in the broader sense, including the mixed forms, builds directly on the repertoire of commercial works. In the long run, this part of UGC probably depends on an ample supply of new, valuable professional works. UGC is not yet associated with a reduction in supply of professional material. The growing dissemination and consumption of UGC demonstrates that these types of works are of considerable value, adding to professional content.",

      "abstract": "How can copyright promote innovation in digital markets? Based on economic reasoning and empirical evidence, this paper provides an original perspective on this question. It focuses on two aspects of digitization \u2013 unauthorized copying and digital retailing \u2013 and how they affect two determinants of innovation \u2013 competition and appropriability in copyright industries. Unauthorized copying has ambiguous consequences: on the one hand, it affects the extent to which suppliers of reproducible creative works can appropriate the value of these intangible goods; on the other hand, unauthorized copying has increased competition between suppliers of creative works, and is associated with substantial productivity increases. Contrary to common expectations, our empirical evidence suggests that digital retailing is not associated with disintermediation and has not made the market for recorded music more contestable. Furthermore, the market power of Internet-based intermediaries can undermine the appropriability of creators, which has not yet been acknowledged in debates on copyright reforms. In this context, copyright policy that focuses on controlling unauthorized use can be ineffective. It needs to be complemented by regulation that limits the market power of digital retailers.",

      "intervention_response": "*Unauthorized digital copying does not only affect the appropriability for creators and rights holders. The empirical literature also indicates that digital copying has increased competition between suppliers of content, and the record industry has become more productive over recent years: while revenues have fallen considerably, the empirical literature to date suggests that the supply of new creative works has continued to increase rapidly (Waldfogel 2011, 2012; Handke 2012a). Digital retailing may co-determine this development, as it makes trading of copyright works more efficient. However, according to the evidence presented in this paper, digital retailing does not promote the position of newcomers and fringe suppliers, and is thus unlikely to promote competition between firms supplying copyright works. \n\n*The appropriability of copyright works does not only depend on end-user behaviour. It also depends on the bargaining position of rights holders with (other) intermediaries. The current understanding of markets for information services suggests that digital retailers are likely to acquire a dominant position in markets for copyright works. This paper presents preliminary empirical evidence of such a development. Market power of digital retailers is bound to undermine the prospects of creators and rights holders to appropriate much of the value of the works they supply.\n\n*In a context of digitization, it is not adequate for copyright policy to concentrate on control over the use of copyright works. In the economic perspective, copyright is a costly means to promote pecuniary incentives for content creation. There is little point in establishing exclusive rights over the use information goods if the rights holders are in no position to benefit from it because they face quasi-monopolistic intermediaries.",

      "proposition": "*In Germany, digital retailing has expanded rapidly since the formation of the iTunes store in 2004 \u2013 see table 1. Digital unit sales were negligible before and increased from up 7.9 million in 2004 to 61.6 million in 2009, when they made up more than a third of the market for authorized copies of sound recordings. By 2012, the majority of unit sales were \u2018digital\u2019. Furthermore, income from subscription services and advertising-financed music streaming services online have been growing rapidly (not covered in Table 1). To be sure, in terms of retail value, the share of the digital market is lower, since average retail prices per unit in the digital market are lower. Nevertheless, it is clear that large parts of the legitimate market for recorded music has become \u2018digital\u2019 since 2004.\n\n*The most relevant observation for this paper is that growth in the number of record companies was relatively high before the popularization of digital retailing. The number of record companies expanded less rapidly in the period in which digital sales started to pick up. In the five years from 1999 to 2003, when authorized digital retailing had been negligible, the number of firms had expanded by an average of 68 firms per year. After the iTunes store had 18 started operating in 2004, digital retailing proliferated. From 2005 to 2009, the number of record companies increased on average by less than 12 firms per year, and by less than 21 firms per year for the entire period from 2005 to 2013. This is a striking difference from the years preceding digital retailing, especially because accumulated revenues from sales of sound recordings in Germany fell much more rapidly from 1999 to 2003 (physical and digital). Nominal revenues fell by over 34% in the five years before substantial digital retailing from 1999 and 2003 (BV Phono 2008). It fell by 12.5% in the five years after 2004, from 2005 to 2009, and by 16.9% in the nine years from 2005 to 2013 (BV Phono 2014). Of course, in a context of broader and disruptive technological change, other factors may be driving these developments. Nevertheless, the number of record companies increased more rapidly before digital retailing started taking up. It is thus improbable that digital retailing would have promoted market entry by record companies.",

In the latter case, the PDPPP was able to invent around the technology.  A third Respondent reported that a company had refused to grant a license for an \u201cenabling technology\u201d even though it was for a different field of use, and the PDPPP was able to use other technologies to fill the gap.

A number of respondents did note that wider reform (such as a new tort consistent with the law elsewhere in the EU) would be desirable in the long term.

It was noted by one such respondent however that a change to a new, wider tort would be too dramatic at this point and would lead to further uncertainty.\n\n*The majority of respondents considered the draft bill to be suitable for the special Law Commission Bill procedure, agreeing that the proposals are uncontroversial. It was noted that key stakeholders have been consulted and that the \u201csensible and measured\u201d changes proposed have a strong consensus of support.

This year has seen greater collaboration, with the structures detailed in the previous Report starting to see results - strategically as well as tactically on the ground with law enforcement activities. Key projects are coming to fruition and ongoing commitments by the IP community are keeping up the pressure on IP criminals. Last year\u2019s IP Crime Report attracted an unprecedented amount of media coverage. It became clear that awareness of IP crime and efforts to detect and dismantle the criminality behind it were increasing, and the link between IP crime and other criminality was being realised. This year\u2019s Report follows suit by presenting the views of IP Crime Group members and the wider community involved in IP and IP crime enforcement. Contributions for the Report have increased, and the commitment by Trading Standards Authorities to complete the annual IP Crime Survey have increased from 54% to 87% providing a clearer picture of their enforcement of IP crime.",

In the United States, the transfer of infringing and non-pornographic content is estimated to be responsible for a minimum of 17.53% of all Internet bandwidth.\n\n* An in-depth analysis of the most popular 10,000 pieces of content (torrents) managed by PublicBT found: 63.7% of content managed by PublicBT was non-pornographic content that was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 35.2% was film content \u2013 all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 14.5% was television content \u2013 all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately. Of this, 1.5% of content was Japanese anime and 0.3% was sports content; 6.7% was PC or console games -  all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately;2.9% was music content \u2013 all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 4.2% was software \u2013 all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately;0.2% was book (text or audio) or comic content \u2013 all of which was copyrighted and shared illegitimately; 35.8% was pornography, the largest single category. The copyright status of this was more difficult to discern but the majority is believed to be copyrighted and most likely shared illegitimately; 0.48% (just 48 files out of 10,000) could not be identified. Of all 10,000 files comprising the most popular content held on the PublicBT tracker, only one was identified as non-copyrighted (a file containing a list of IP addresses used to help users guard against spam and peer to peer monitoring). There is no evidence to support the idea that the transfer of non-copyrighted content such as Linux distributions makes up a significant amount of bittorrent traffic. Analysis strongly indicates that private bittorrent sites (which would not usually make use of PublicBT) are overwhelmingly used for the purposes of illegitimately sharing copyrighted data. \n\n*An examination of 2,000 random links pointing to content held on cyberlockers found that 91.5% of links pointing to non-pornographic material were linking to copyrighted material, or 73.15% of all links.   \n\n*A comparison of video streaming site usage estimated that 4.7% of video streaming data traffic is copyrighted content illegitimately streamed from video hosting sites.\n\n*Analysis of content posted to a number of Usenet newsgroups found that at least 93.4% of posts contained copyrighted material. \n\n* On the day of analysis, most upload and download activity was concentrated amongst a small number of those 2.7m torrents with 34.9% of all peers involved in the top 10,000 (just 0.37% of all torrents). There was an enormous long-tail of content which had only a few or no seeds or a few or no leechers. The chart shows the breakdown of all 2.72m swarms according to the number of downloaders (commonly called leechers) attached to each swarm12. Clearly, most of the swarms had only a small number of active downloaders or no active downloaders at all. 0.2% of torrents (6,468) had 100 or more downloaders; 2.6% of torrents (71,405) had from ten to 99 downloaders; 51.9% of torrents (1,413,606) had from one to nine downloaders; 45.2% of torrents (1,229,961) had no active downloads. A similar spread was evident for seeders (users holding a complete copy of the file). For almost half of all torrents (1.32m or 48.5%), no seed was connected.On the other hand, a very small overall proportion of content attracted large numbers of downloaders, representing a large proportion of all connected users.  As stated above, torrent swarms with 100 or more downloaders represented just 0.24% of the available 2.72m torrents, but more than one in three \u2013 30.4% - of all peers connected to PublicBT.

Though this provides a majority response consistent with copyright law, it is a relatively weak majority, and a far smaller differential (28%) than the patent scenario (51%). Results are displayed in Figure 1.93 Two-tailed binomial tests reveal that participants were significantly more likely to conclude that the creator was entitled to damages than to conclude that the creator was not entitled to damages in both the patent (p < .001) and copyright (p < .001) scenarios\n\n* Scenario 2: Creativity Threshold. rsuant to patent law\u2019s requirement that the invention be nonobvious. Contrary to intellectual property law, 60% of respondents in the patent condition concluded that the inventor was entitled to intellectual property protection. Consistent with the law, 75% of respondents in the copyright condition similarly concluded that the author was entitled to intellectual property protection. Two-tailed binomial tests demonstrate that participants were significantly more likely to grant intellectual property protection to a novel, obvious creation than to deny protection in both the patent (p < .001) and copyright (p < .001) scenarios.\n\n*  Scenario 3: Independent Creators. Consistent with copyright law, 60% of participants in the copyright condition concluded that the later, independent sculptor should be entitled to separate intellectual property rights in the second sculpture. Contrary to patent law, 55% of participants in the patent condition concluded that the later, independent inventor should be entitled to separate intellectual property rights in the second medical device. Twotailed binomial tests indicate that participants were significantly more likely to award the later independent creator intellectual property rights than to deny rights in both the patent (p < .001) and copyright (p < .001) scenarios.\n\n* Scenario 4: Joint Creators. Participants in both the patent and copyright conditions were relatively evenly split concerning whether intellectual property rights should be awarded to the secondary contributor.

At the outset, the clearest implication of the demonstrated unsoundness of the incentive theory is that legal scholars, judges, and lawmakers should tighten their discourse. We should no longer tolerate easy assertions that intellectual goods need external incentives. Indeed, the current legal literature on intellectual property is rife with reliance on the incentive theory. It undergirds IP discourse generally. Today, as scholars weigh in about the future direction of intellectual property law, this great fallacy causes them to draw erroneous conclusions and to champion ill-considered changes in the law. \n\n*  Not Confusing the Exceptions with the Rule. There are undoubtedly exceptions. Valuable intellectual assets whose development almost certainly required the incentive of external rewards, such as those made possible by intellectual property rights, include virtually all large-budget major motion pictures,  virtually all large-budget television series, and many or most new  pharmaceutical compounds. The exceptions to the general rule of spontaneous creative labor, however, do not disprove the rule. Why not? The exceptions arise out  of the costs of production and distribution of creative and innovative labors, not the creative labor per se. \n\n* Sunsetting Intellectual Property Entitlements. Much of intellectual property law may ultimately be justifiable; that is, it may ultimately turn out, after data is gathered and carefully weighed, that a persuasive case can be made to justify wide swaths of entitlement-granting IP law. But, by the same token, most of intellectual property law is currently unjustified; that is, no such persuasive case has been presently put forth.  The legal doctrines of patent and copyright law\u2014in the manifold kinds of works to which they are applied and the many forms of industry in which they inhere\u2014exist almost wholly without a careful case having been laid for their existence. In light of that, the overall prescription is that intellectual property law, in general, should be sunsetted.\n\n* The economic centerpiece in the conventional wisdom justifying intellectual property law is a longstanding blunder. There is no broad necessity for incentives for intellectual labor. As a general matter, innovative and creative activity will thrive without artificial support.",

Copyright owners and technology firms negotiate over new ways of distributing and transmitting creative works. Understanding the shadow that copyright casts on private negotiations will allow policy makers to better design the statute in a way that encourages more competition, diversity, and transactional efficiency in markets for digital goods. Prime examples of copyright licensing negotiations are the attempts to license digital music services over the past decade. In this Article we present the first qualitative and quantitative data about the licensing process for on-demand music streaming services, gleaned from confidential interviews with executives and attorneys. We report our findings about the time it takes to license a nascent service, if negotiations succeed; the number of record labels and publishers with which new music services typically deal; the general processes through which these licenses evolve; and how changes in the law over the period may have affected the dynamics of these negotiations. We find that copyright law, alongside business practices and professional attitudes, sets complex background rules for these private licensing negotiations. Copyright shapes, constrains, and also presents opportunities for innovation.",

To consider the merits of copyright reform in one direction or another, policy makers should be gathering all the empirical evidence they can. This Article has aimed to contribute to deliberations over copyright reform by describing the nature of the licensing negotiations for digital music services. Secrecy and private information render it infeasible to construct a large, quantitative data set consisting of both successful and failed attempts at licensing. Studies like ours, however, based on interviews with individuals directly involved in licensing negotiations, shed important light on the realities of the marketplace. \n\n* The direct licensing process can require a surprisingly similar amount of time (at the median) to the time it takes a rate-setting proceeding to reach its resolution. In both cases there are the extremes\u2014when the rate-setting process drags for years, or the direct licensing process never succeeds. But we do need to understand whether and why these two very different paths to market\u2014each determining service features, royalty rates, and consumer pricing in different ways\u2014may actually require quite similar periods of time.\n\n* In future designs of the copyright statute, the goal should be efficient resolution of conflicts between copyright owners and firms with new distribution technologies. Congress must understand that unless they choose to make certain arrangements mandatory (i.e., unless Congress forbids contracting around the copyright statute in various ways) their statutory scheme is merely one constraint in a complex private negotiation. Copyright law, along with business practices and perceptions, determines each side\u2019s bargaining position in private licensing negotiations.

At the median, licensing activities have required about eighteen months of effort. The majority of this time period, roughly \u00a0five-\u00ad\u2010sixths, is spent in discussions with major rights holders, those \u201cmajor labels\u201d that are also major publishers. The remaining proportion, about one-\u00ad\u2010sixth of the period, is spent negotiating with major rights collectives and other aggregators\n\n* There was a slight decrease of approximately three months over the last decade in terms of the time it has taken to obtain licenses from the set of sound recording owners considered crucial for launch. \n\n*  The number of sound recordings with which services launch has increased dramatically over the last decade. Pressplay and MusicNet, both of which first offered their services in December 2001, each launched with approximately 100,000 tracks\u2014just a portion of the recordings contained in the catalogs of the then five major labels. In contrast, Rdio launched its service in 2010 claiming greater than seven million tracks available. The most significant factor that increased the number of tracks available was the emergence of large aggregators of independent rights.\n\n* It is possible to see a significant decrease over the last decade in the amount of time it has taken to obtain a sufficient collection of licenses covering the use of musical works for interactive services\u2014as long as that use fits a discrete set of qualifications. What once was a prolonged operation requiring not months but years of ongoing negotiations can now, at least in large part, be accomplished in as short a timeframe as under ninety days. \n\n*  At least in the past, certain service offerings that were not licensed by the quorum of major labels and publishers were voluntarily licensed by other sets of rights owners.",

      "proposition": "* All of the 32 countries (out of 40 countries assigned to this study) with copyright legislations surveyed in this study have some form of exception for the benefit of educational activities.  Most of these are formulated based on Article 10(2) of the Berne Convention. Although the details may differ, the first group of countries has exceptions that mirror the approach in Article 10(2), which is to provide a general exception to sanction the utilization of any work by way of illustration in publications, broadcasts or sound or visual recordings for teaching, to the extent justified by the purpose.  This includes the use of a work for instructional communication.  However, four countries have expressly limited their exceptions to reproductions only, and five have imposed the requirement of face-to-face teaching.  This is likely to create an issue as regards the application of these exceptions for distance and e-learning.\n\n*The second group of countries has implemented the Article 10(2) exception through the enumeration of excepted aspects of educational activities as exceptions.  The attendant conditions for these exceptions can vary in detail, but the excepted activities are chrestomathies, abstracts, educational performances and broadcasts, school textbooks, school rentals and examinations.  In the absence of a general or catch-all exception in their legislation, countries adopting the \u201cenumeration\u201d approach may need to constantly update their copyright exceptions to deal with new uses of works as part of educational instruction.  Given the increasing breadth and variation of educational curriculum, the choice of using a residual educational use exception based on the three-step test seems like a good solution. \n\n* Most countries have exceptions that exempt the personal or private use of works for research or private study purposes.  However, concerns about book piracy have led a first group of eight countries that have broad \u201cpersonal or private use\u201d exceptions to exclude from the scope of their exceptions the reprography of the whole or a substantial part of books or musical works.  The second group of countries addresses this problem with the concept of \u201cfair use\u201d that creates opportunities for individualistic determinations of permissible usage in each case.  The tension between the potential for \u201cfair use\u201d to serve as a residual exception to permit unanticipated uses of works that add to social utility and to create much harm from its misuse by end users and consumers to collectively make multiple copies of works is  unfortunately a tension that is inherent in the very principle of \u201cfair use\u201d itself (that of a relatively open-ended rule) which can be ameliorated with the recognition of various presumptions of \u201cfair use\u201d where the extent of the work copied is small or determined by the nature of the work e.g. an article in a periodical. \n\n* No less than 16 countries in the countries surveyed in this study have updated their copyright legislation with provisions to deal with technological measures.  However, only a few have provisions to deal with the issue of possible breach of laws protecting the breach of technological measures for educational purposes.  The growing proliferation of electronic books, compilations and databases that are digitally protected may pose challenges for educational institutions seeking to provide access to these legitimately acquired resources for instructional purposes (for instance, to enable multiple access or to make multiple copies of such works for distribution, when the technological measures only permit one copy to be made).",

Auran provide an interesting approach which is responsive to the needs of the fan developers and in most respects provides a best practice model. That cannot be said for all platform owners. The\nimmediate challenge is to conceptualise a commercial and legal framework that will best facilitate the new dimensions of distributed production networks in games and other emergent areas of the creative industries.

Far from benign occurrences, copyright false positives inflict significant social harm in the form of increased litigation and transaction costs, distortions of licensing markets through rent-seeking behavior, increased piracy due to diminished public adherence with copyright law, and the systemic erosion of free speech rights and the public domain.\n\nTo combat this problem, this Article analyzes the causes that give rise to false positives, as well as their legal and social effects, and offers policy recommendations targeted at mitigating the damage of false positives. These policy recommendations include heightening the registration requirements to include a substantive review of all copyright claims; the promulgation of regulations dictating that copyright registrations be periodically renewed; and revision to the statutory damage provisions of the Copyright Act in order to encourage litigation that would help to excise false positives from the copyright corpus.",

Far from benign occurrences, copyright false positives inflict significant social harm in the form of increased litigation and transaction costs, distortions of licensing markets through rent-seeking behavior, increased piracy due to diminished public adherence with copyright law, and the systemic erosion of free speech rights and the public domain.\n\nTo combat this problem, this Article analyzes the causes that give rise to false positives, as well as their legal and social effects, and offers policy recommendations targeted at mitigating the damage of false positives. These policy recommendations include heightening the registration requirements to include a substantive review of all copyright claims; the promulgation of regulations dictating that copyright registrations be periodically renewed; and revision to the statutory damage provisions of the Copyright Act in order to encourage litigation that would help to excise false positives from the copyright corpus.",

      "abstract": "Copyright law is widely perceived as the means to promote social welfare by providing necessary incentive for intellectual creation. However, there has been little clarity in copyright literature on how artists actually respond to copyright incentives: What factors motivate artists to create works? How do artists perceive the usefulness of copyright protection? Would artists continue their artistic careers in a world without copyright law? This article contains a systematic study regarding copyright incentives, based on industrial statistics and extensive interviews from the music industry in China, a virtual copyright-free environment featuring one of the highest piracy rates in the world and having forced dramatic transformation of music businesses.\n\nThe empirical research indicates three seemingly paradoxical phenomena: While 17.9% of all the musicians in the sample referred to economic benefits as at least part of their motivations for music creation, 97.4% specifically recognized money as being important and helpful for music creation; While 56.4% alleged that copyright piracy did not affect their creative motivations, 72% agreed that copyright piracy does affect music creation; While 53.8% explicitly admitted that they had little awareness or knowledge of copyright, 92.3% indicated that the current level of copyright protection is insufficient and 71.8% suggested that copyright law should provide strong incentives for music creation.\n\nThe empirical evidence itself provides compelling explanations for such paradoxes: Even though musicians primarily create music for music\u2019s sake, copyright law could still supply powerful incentive for music production in a way that not only caters to market demand, but also allows for broader artistic freedom. Copyright piracy that does not necessarily affect musicians\u2019 intrinsic motivations could nevertheless affect music creation in terms of the time spent on music creation, the volume of investment in music creation, and ultimately the quality of music creation. Most importantly, copyright incentives do not function as a reward that musicians consciously bargain for and chase after but as a mechanism that preserves market conditions for gifted musicians to prosper, including a decent standard of living, sufficient income to cover production costs, and maximum artistic autonomy during the creative process.",

      "abstract": "Information technology-enabled exchanges have enhanced the viability of a variety of secondary\nmarkets, notably markets for used books. Electronic used book exchanges, in particular, offer a\nwider selection, lower search costs, and significantly lower prices than physical used bookstores\ndo. The increased viability of these used book markets has caused concern among groups such as\nthe Book Publishers Association and Author\u2019s Guild who believe that used book markets will\nsignificantly cannibalize new book sales.\nThis proposition, while theoretically possible, is based on speculation as opposed to empirical\nevidence. In this research, we use a unique dataset collected from Amazon.com\u2019s new and used\nmarketplaces to estimate the impact of IT-enabled used book markets on new book sales. We use\nthese data to calculate the impact of these secondary market exchanges on consumer and publisher\nwelfare by calculating the cross-price elasticity of new books sales with respect to used\nbook prices.\nOur analysis suggests that IT-enabled secondary market exchanges increase consumer surplus by\napproximately $70 million annually. Further, we find that only 15% of used book sales at Amazon\ncannibalize new book purchases. The remaining 85% of used book sales apparently would\nnot have occurred at Amazon\u2019s new book prices. This low cannibalization means that book publishers\nlose only $32 million in gross profit annually (about 0.2% of total gross profit) due to the\npresence of Amazon\u2019s used book markets. Further, the additional used book readership gain\nfrom these electronic markets may mitigate author losses through increased revenue from secondary\nsources such as speaking and licensing fees. These surplus changes, combined with the estimated\n$64 million the used book market added to Amazon\u2019s gross profits, show that IT-enabled\nused markets for books have a strong positive first-order impact on total welfare.",

We find that academic users are somewhat more likely to adopt open source software than private firms.

The sudden shutdown of the popular file hosting platform Megaupload.com on January 19, 2012 significantly (and unexpectedly) changed the availability of illegal movie downloads overnight. We compare box office revenues of movies that were available on Megaupload to those that were not pre- and post-shutdown and find that box office revenues of a majority of movies did not increase. The average effect is even negative. We show that only movies that premiere in a relatively large number of theaters benefitted from the closure of Megaupload. This is consistent with word-of-mouth effects, where online piracy can act as a mechanism to spread information about a good from consumers with low willingness to pay to consumers with high willingness to pay. This information-spreading effect of illegal downloads seems to be especially important for movies with smaller audiences, while for movies aimed at large audiences, the substitution effect between free and paid consumption weighs more heavily.",

      "proposition": "Quite surprising in light of previous empirical work, we find that box office revenues of a majority of movies that have been available on Megaupload do not increase in response to the shutdown. Indeed, the average effect of the shutdown on a movie that had previously been available on Megaupload was negative. In more differentiated analyses, we find that only movies that were on wide release in a relatively large number of theaters (blockbusters) benefited from the unavailability of Megaupload, while the effect on more narrowly released movies was neutral and even negative for niche movies. We subject these results to a number of robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations using different specifications and additional data.\nA mechanism that can explain these prima facie counterintuitive findings is that piracy generates positive externalities through information about the quality of an experience good spilling over from pirates to (potential) legal consumers. Once it becomes significantly less easy to consume pirated content online, as was the case in our empirical setting, we would expect that at least some consumers revert to legal consumption, increasing movie revenues. At the same time, the positive externalities from pirates to legal consumers vanish, so that a number of prospective legal consumers (who would pay for watching the movie) end up being less informed about specific titles, which reduces their likelihood of going to the movies. The net effect on a specific movie\u2019s revenues then depends on how important the information externality is for the performance of this movie. Large blockbusters (i.e., wide-release movies) may be able to compensate with large advertising budgets, while word-of-mouth is likely to matter more for movies targeted at smaller audiences.",

      "abstract": "Copyright promotes creativity. Copyright hinders creativity. These statements reflect the contested nature of copyright, today more than ever before. The last twenty years have seen rapid advancements in digital technologies and information and communication systems. These advancements have had profound effects on creative activities: the process of production, dissemination, exploitation and consumption of creative output has changed; opportunities for novel ways and forms of creation, representation and manipulation of information have arisen; and, the attitudes and behaviour of creators and consumers of creative output and a host of intermediary participants in the process have transformed. As a result, copyright law has faced considerable and persistent practical challenges in adapting its contours to the digital environment. More importantly, the role of copyright, as a framework for regulating creative activities, has also come under scrutiny. \n\nWhat then is the role of copyright law in the everyday context of new and emerging creative activities -- that are borne out of the very copying and distribution technologies that have challenged copyright? How do the creative practitioners involved in such activities relate to copyright law? This chapter explores the interaction between copyright and the everyday life of artists in the digital environment. It focuses on the role of copyright in the every day context of a specific creative activity: digital art practice. It draws upon the findings from a qualitative empirical study, consisting of in-depth interviews with digital artists in the UK and Ireland, to peer \u2018through the looking glass\u2019 at the perspectives and practices of digital artists and finds \u2018a messy wonderland of copyright in action\u2019. A wonderland where: artists challenge and resist the law\u2019s default positions and policy\u2019s dominant presumptions, artists are informed and influenced by multiple elements and contextual factors in their process of meaning-making and decision making about copyright, and, artists face moral dilemmas and are pulled in different directions with respect to their perspectives and decisions regarding copyright.\n\nSection II of this chapter contextualizes the study and outlines the methodology employed. Section III and IV presents some of the findings from the study to demonstrate how the interviewees were challenging ownership and valuing authorship and illustrate how a variety of factors influenced the artists\u2019 understandings around copyright. Section V provides concluding remarks.",

Similarly, copyright protection, which does not meet the needs of the creators\nwhom it aims to protect, can also lead to scepticism about the law. The interviewees\u2019 own\nmeanings and images of the law that they had internalized in their creative practice illustrates\nthat copyright law and policy in this case implied little for those whose creative practice it aimed to govern. As such, a challenge for copyright policy making is not just to increase awareness of the law and access to works for the users of the system, but to ensure that it retains the faith of those whom it primarily claims to benefit: the creators.\nThe interviewees were clearly not convinced that copyright was working for creators\u2019 benefit.\nHowever, they did not discount that it could. For the copyright system to support creativity, it\nrequires the confidence of its stakeholders, in particular the creators who \u2018must see it as appropriate, effective, fair and reasonable.\u2019 For the copyright framework to be effective in\nsupporting new and emerging creative activities, the first step could very well be to regain\nlegitimacy and confidence about its potential role and relevance amongst digital creators.",

      "abstract": "Over the last years, a vibrant global market for TV show formats has developed. New game show, casting, soap, telenovela, documentary and other formats are sold to broadcasting stations in dozens of countries, leading to a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. As an analysis of U.S. and European intellectual property law demonstrates, TV show formats are difficult to protect by intellectual property law. Standard theory would predict that in the absence of intellectual property protection, the TV show format industry has insufficient incentives to invest in creative innovation. This article presents a novel theory to explain why the TV show format market is thriving despite a low level of format protection. On the supply side of the industry, demand for TV show formats is hard to predict, return on them is highly skewed, and market participants are both developing original formats and imitating others\u2019 formats. On the demand side, TV show formats are experience goods, and TV viewers sometimes prefer familiar products. As a result, the TV show format market is subject to herding effects on both sides of the market. The interaction of supply-side and demand-side herding leads to fashion cycles in TV show formats. The industry uses the limited protection against format imitation, but has adapted to the fashion cycle. This article tells the story of how an industry has developed institutions enabling it to cope with uncertain demand and unpredictable profitability, while benefiting from limited appropriability of innovation and from the fashion cycles which underlie the innovative process. It demonstrates the great diversity and flexibility of appropriation strategies in a world of limited and uncertain allocation of property rights.",

Unlike other media industries, the TV format industry has developed mechanisms to cope with this situation, without having to rely too much on format protection. Beyond a core protection against close format imitation, format developers and broadcasters, who are often both innovators and imitators, benefit from a regime of free-format appropriability, as this enables them to allocate profitability risk across the industry and to cope with uncertainty of demand. TV formats go in and out of fashion, and the format industry has developed tools to coordinate and ride the fashion cycle. The key to understanding TV format imitation is the cycle that can make an industry thrive beyond the borders of a weak property regime.",

Many of dojinshi are derivative works of popular anime or manga but are sold without official permissions from the copyright holders. Thus, it is highly possible that the activity of\ndojinshi  creators violates Article 28 of the Copyright Law of Japan, which states the rights of original authors in the situation of exploitation by derivative works. We demonstrate that ignoring copyright infringement by a derivative creator can be optimal for the copyright holder based on an economic model that incorporates both positive and negative externalities of derivative work.

This article explores the nature and implications of fan-translation and distribution of cultural commodities through a case study of English fan-subbing of anime (subtitling of Japanese animation in English).

It exemplifies participatory media fandom whose globalization exceeds that of cultural industries in terms of extent and velocity. The article argues that fan-subbing, pursued as a hobby, can unsettle the global mediascape by allowing multiple mediations of cultural text and presenting a new model of content distribution and its organization based on consumers\u2019 voluntary work.",

Under such pressure, the anime industry has begun framing fan-subbing as piracy. Nevertheless, the industry does not regard taking legal action as a good solution because this could alienate the fan-subbing community which has constituted the core of anime fandom. The industry\u2019s current strategy appears to be exploring a new medium \u2013 such as the internet \u2013 for global distribution of anime, but it does not look effective at reducing the demand for fan-subbing. Like DVD distribution, authorized streaming is territorially and technologically bounded and thus still cannot subdue the immediate mediation and borderless mobility of fan-subs. In this sense, we can perhaps view a significant part of the overseas anime market as a so-called missing market: in spite of overseas fans\u2019 growing demands for anime, a market hardly exists due to constraints such as high costs for global distribution, limited technologies (and thus limitations on visual quality as seen from authorized online streaming) and anime\u2019s increasing assimilation to and inclusion in the free knowledge of global anime fandom. Anime\u2019s globally dispersed missing market has been and can be explored only by the free labour of dedicated fans who have strong missions and motivations and an enthusiasm for technological innovation, and who voluntarily donate their time and skills, and can work virtually 24 hours per day collaborating with colleagues in different continents. Such a type of operation looks hard to copy and be adopted by cultural industries that work strictly within the commercial paradigm. It is yet to be observed whether or how the anime industry can come up with commercially viable models of global anime distribution that can successfully make markets out of overseas fans\u2019 desire for anime consumption.",

The case study of anime fan-subbing sheds a light on the fandom\u2019s evolving dynamics. English fan-subbing of anime was triggered by the gaps in the overseas distribution of anime and, consequently, the unmet demand of US fans. Initially, it functioned within the industry structure instead of giving birth to alternatives to the authorized products.\nThe consensus of \u2018drop the project if licensed in the US (or North America)\u2019 reflected fandom\u2019s attempt to limit its effect to that of supplementing the local anime industry\u2019s offer. In addition, fan-subbing\u2019s geographical and technological constraints kept its role as a connector of missing links between the industry and viewers. However, with the arrival of digital technologies and the globalization of the fan-subbing community, fan-subbing has emerged as a new, popular model of global distribution of anime.\nThe mediation of anime text by fans is likely to lead to a surge of multiple, sometimes competing mediations of global flow of anime \u2013 by the industry as well as its consumers. Even within fansubbing itself, competing mediations are not uncommon: today we can observe multiple speed subbing groups working on the same projects, resulting in different versions of fansubs of an anime. The existence of plural mediations, within and outside the market-based system, intensifies the tension in the global mediascape by spreading multiple goals, legitimacies and operational practices of the transnational flow of cultural contents.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines how the complexity of motivations and practices found in a specialist social networking site intersect with the institution of intellectual property (IP). IP is a set of conventions and legal practices which evolved in a very different environment of production and distribution. In a co-creative social networking site we find a concatenation of amateurs, semiprofessionals and professionals, occupying multiple roles in gifting economies, reputation economies, monetised charitable economies and full commercial economies. People use, buy, sell, give away, and consume in this mixed economy that can be characterised as a 'social network market'. The users of online social networking sites (SNS) find themselves having to come to grips with the complexity of IP law in order to participate fully. This paper uses Ravelry, a specialist SNS for knitters and spinners, to analyse the negotiations that take place around IP in a social network market, in particular the way the discourse of copyright is mobilised to negotiate the territory between amateurs and professionals.",

      "abstract": "Mainstream scholarly publishers have since 2004 started to offer authors in subscription journals the possibility to free their individual articles from access barriers against a payment (hybrid OA). This has been marketed as a possible gradual transition path between subscription and open access to the scholarly journal literature, and the publishers have pledged to decrease their subscription prices in proportion to the uptake of the hybrid option. The number of hybrid journals has doubled in the past couple of years and is now over 4,300, and the number of such articles was around 12,000 in 2011. On average only 1-2 % of eligible authors utilize the OA option, due mainly to the generally high price level of typically 3,000 USD. There are, however, a few publishers and individual journals with a much higher uptake. This article takes a closer look at the development of hybrid OA and discusses, from an author-centric viewpoint, the possible reasons for the lack of\nsuccess of this business model.",

The big publishers have already included around half their titles, probably most of the ones deemed to have better chances of uptake, and many university presses and society publishers already have a clear majority of their titles in their hybrid offering. Thus there is relative little scope for growth via the addition of new titles. The best chances of rapidly increasing the uptake would be to drastically reduce the price level. But that could in turn put the subscription income at risk. Since the marginal cost of keeping the hybrid offering running is almost zero publishers are likely to continue with this route in its current form in the near future. \nBut in parallel the trend seems now to be for many established publishers to start wholly new full Open Access journals, and in particular journals with very broad disciplinary coverage and reasonable article processing charges.",

Roughly half of these articles have been deposited in PubMedCentral by the\npublishers and the share of articles in biomedicine is even higher. \nAmong the lessons learnt is that at the 3,000 USD price level the overwhelming majority of authors do not pay the charges. It is difficult to know to what extent this is due to lack of awareness of the option and of the benefits of OA, unwillingness to pay at the prevailing price level or difficulties in funding the hybrid charge. \nThe overall conclusion of this study must be that the hybrid experiment, at least in the case of the major publishers and with the current price level, has failed as a way of significantly adding to the volumes of OA articles, and that hybrid OA will remain a very marginal phenomenon in the scholarly publishing landscape.",

      "proposition": "1. In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (\u2018typical\u2019) wage of \u00a312,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of \u20ac12,000/\u00a38,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n\n2. Although authors\u2019 earnings are well below average, the crucial distinguishing feature is the risky nature of the profession. Writers work in winner-take-all markets. The distribution of income is highly unequal, as reflected in high Gini Coefficients: The top 10% of professional writers in the UK earn about 60% of total income (they earn at least \u00a368,200 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 8% of total income (Gini: 0.63). In Germany, the top 10% of professional writers earn about 41% of total income (they earn at least \u20ac40,000/\u00a327,600 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 12% of total income (Gini: 0.52). In contrast, the national Gini Coefficient for all employees in the UK is 0.33; in Germany it is 0.31.\n\n3. Compared to the UK, writers\u2019 earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. In the UK sample, 7.2% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 or more from writing (mean=\u00a3188,062). In the German sample, just 1.7% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 (\u20ac145,000) or more. No German writers in the sample earned more than \u00a3345,000 (\u20ac500,000).\n\n4. Only 20% of UK writers earn all their income from writing. 60% of professional writers need another job to survive, both in Germany and the UK. However, UK and German writers show a distinct sociological profile. German authors are prepared to enter the market as a professional author (=allocating more than 50% of their time to writing) at a much lower median income than UK authors. UK authors also appear to have a more \u201cestablishment\u201d background. UK writers\u2019 households (including partners\u2019 earnings and income from non-writing jobs) earn almost double the amount of their German counterparts (UK writers\u2019 household mean: \u00a355,620; German writers\u2019 household mean: \u20ac41,644/\u00a328,734).\n\n5. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed. For UK professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.63, for total individual income of writers it is 0.51, and for total household income of writers it is 0.47. For German professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.52, for total individual income it is 0.43, and for total household income it is 0.42. The distribution of income for collecting society payments (which follows actual use) is more skewed than contractual writing income (which includes risk mitigating advances). The Gini Coefficient for ALCS (UK collecting society) payments to professional writers is 0.78; for VG Wort (German collecting society) payments it is 0.67. This suggests that current copyright law may exacerbate risk.\n\n6. Writers who bargain with their publishers/producers earn about twice as much as those who don\u2019t (both in Germany and the UK). Compared to the UK, disputes over moral rights (the authors\u2019 rights to be credited where their work is used and to prevent its derogatory treatment) are double as likely in Germany, reflecting perhaps the \u201cinalienable\u201d legal status of these rights in Germany.\n\n7. Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n\n8. Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany.",

These papers span a variety of methods, time periods, and contexts. Moreover, while the one dissenting paper should be lauded for innovative methods of data collection, and for being among the very first papers published addressing this question, there have been significant questions raised about the appropriateness of its instrumental variable, and as such we believe it is appropriate to weigh its finding that piracy does not harm sales relative to the large number of papers with opposite findings.",

It has never been so important to foster the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d leading from Research and Development (R&D) investment to jobs \u2013 via innovation, competitive advantage and economic success \u2013 as in today\u2019s world of increasingly globalised markets and the knowledge\neconomy. This process depends on several different factors, but an efficient system of intellectual property rights (IPR) undoubtedly ranks among the most important, given IP\u2019s capacity to encourage creativity and innovation, in all its various forms, throughout the economy.\nEurope already has a long tradition in this area: European countries have played a major part in\nshaping a modern and balanced system of IP rights which not only guarantees innovators their due\nreward but also stimulates a competitive market. It is nevertheless vital to ensure that the system remains a useful instrument in implementing new innovation policies designed to achieve those goals. At the same time, there have been several calls from industry for indicators to measure the economic impact of IP rights. Moreover, in view of the question marks which, in public debate, have sometimes been raised over IP\u2019s role in supporting innovation and creativity, it is essential that facts and figures be produced to ensure such debate is based on sound evidence.\nThat is why the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), acting through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, and the European Patent Office (EPO) decided to join forces and carry out this study in co-operation with the European Commission, in particular DG Internal Market and Services and Eurostat.\nThere have already been several studies on specific IP rights, industrial sectors or countries, but the OHIM-EPO study is the first to quantify the overall contribution made by IPR\u2011intensive industries to the EU economy, in terms of output, employment, wages and trade, taking into account the major\nIP rights (patents, trade marks, designs, copyrights, geographical indications). Despite the\nconservative approach, reflected in the rigorous methodology applied, the main results are very\nimpressive: IPR-intensive industries generate more than a quarter of employment and more than a\nthird of economic activity in the EU.",

By focusing onlyon the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries. On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by\nIPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR\u2011dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\nOver the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth \u20ac 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU\u2019s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus.\nIPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage\npremium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.",

      "abstract": "This paper compares reward systems to intellectual property rights (patents and copyrights). Under a reward system, innovators are paid for innovations directly by the government (possibly on the basis of sales), and innovations pass immediately into the public domain. Thus, reward systems engender incentives to innovate without creating the monopoly power of intellectual property rights. But a principal difficulty with rewards is the information required for their determination. We conclude in our model that intellectual property rights do not possess a fundamental social advantage over reward systems and that an optional reward system\u2014under which innovators choose between rewards and intellectual property rights\u2014is superior to intellectual\nproperty rights.",

      "abstract": "Fuelled by recent public and private efforts to improve access to scholarly works, academic libraries and archives are increasingly digitizing their special collections and creating online repositories for scholarly works. This enhanced online presence has increased libraries\u2019 exposure to takedown requests from rightsholders and other concerned parties. Using survey questions and interviews, we examined academic libraries\u2019 interaction with both Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) and non-DMCA takedown notices. We found that academic libraries most commonly receive non-DMCA takedown requests that are based on non-copyright issues (such as privacy) or that target materials the library itself has placed online. In general, libraries have well- developed norms and practices in place to manage these types of requests to remove material. We also found, however, that formal DMCA notices directed to libraries have historically been rare, but that this may be changing as open access repositories hosted by libraries grow. In tracing the recent experience of academic libraries that have received DMCA takedown notices targeting material in their open access repositories, we found that libraries have not yet developed norms and practices for addressing these requests. We discuss why this might be, and suggest steps libraries, publishers, and authors can take to best manage copyright conflicts while supporting libraries\u2019 missions to preserve and provide access to knowledge.",

But all too often they find themselves thwarted.\n\nA survey of communication scholars\u2019 practices, conducted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Fair Use and\nAcademic Freedom in the International Communication Association (ICA), reveals that copyright\nignorance and misunderstanding hamper distribution of finished work, derail work in progress, and\nmost seriously, lead communication researchers simply to avoid certain kinds of research altogether.\nNearly half the respondents express a lack of confidence about their copyright knowledge in relation\nto their research. Nearly a third avoided research subjects or questions and a full fifth abandoned\nresearch already under way because of copyright concerns. In addition, many ICA members have\nfaced resistance from publishers, editors, and university administrators when seeking to include\ncopyrighted works in their research. Scholars are sometimes forced to seek copyright holders\u2019\npermission to discuss or criticize copyrighted works. Such permission seeking puts copyright holders\nin a position to exercise veto power over the publication of research, especially research that deals with contemporary or popular media.\n\nThese results demonstrate that scholars in communication frequently encounter confusion, fear, and\nfrustration around the unlicensed use of copyrighted material. These problems, driven largely by\nmisinformation and gatekeeper conservatism, inhibit researchers\u2019 ability both to conduct rigorous\nanalyses and to develop creative methodologies for the digital age.\n\nCommunication scholars can benefit by developing best practices standards for the most ample and\nflexible copyright exemption permitting unlicensed use of copyrighted materials: fair use. While nonU.S. members will not be able to apply this doctrine directly to work done outside the United States, having this interpretation established for U.S. scholars will expand opportunities within a large area of communication research, encourage international scholars to explore their own nations\u2019 copyright exemptions, and provide an important benchmark for non-U.S. scholars looking for models as\ncopyright reform proceeds.",

First, a random sample of more than 2000 new books for sale on Amazon.com is analyzed along with a random sample of almost 2000 songs available on new DVD\u2019s. Copyright status correlates highly with absence from the Amazon shelf. Together with publishing business models, copyright law seems to deter distribution and diminish access.

To measure variation creative output, we use new data on 2,598 operas that premiered across eight states within Italy between 1770 and 1900. These data indicate that the adoption of copyrights led to a significant increase in the number of new operas premiered per state and year. We find that the number of high-quality operas also increased \u2013 measured both by their contemporary popularity and by the longevity of operas. By comparison, evidence for a significant effect of copyright extensions is limited. Our analysis of alternative mechanisms for this increase reveals a substantial shift in composer migration in response to copyrights. Consistent with agglomeration externalities, we also find that cities with a better pre-existing infrastructure of performance spaces benefitted more copyright laws.",

      "proposition": "The paper uses data collected specifically by the authors to test the hypothesis that creativity (in terms of quantity and quality as in durability of the works) is increased by copyright. The test analyses differences in these data by Italian state starting from 1801, contrasting effects of two states where there was copyright from that date with output in other states that did not until much later. The findings are that the presence of copyright increase output and stimulated composer migration. The study does not find any effect for extensions of copyright.\n* Summary statistics on the changes in the number of new operas produced per state and year show that opera production increased significantly after Lombardy and Venetia adopted copyrights (from 1.55 new operas per state and year to 4.48 \u2013 a 189% increase). By comparison, in states that did not offer copyrights, production increased only 54% (from 1.36 to 2.10).\n* The creation of copyright may also have influenced by increasing the quality of new operas if composers had an intrinsic preference for producing high quality works, and if the additional revenue from copyrights relaxed their budget constraint enough to allow them to substitute quality for quantity. \n* Summary statistics indicate that composers in copyright state began to produce significantly more high-quality operas after its introduction in 1801 (composers premiers increased from 0.125 per year to 0.619 \u2013 a 396% increase). By comparison, in states that did not offer copyrights, production increased only 100% (from 0.083 to 0.167).\n* Summary statistics also indicate that composers in state-time pairs with copyright produced more historically popular operas than composers in states without copyrights.\n\nEditorial comment: A fundamental flaw in the paper is that it does not consider any economic effects that might also be associated with these results, specifically the influence of differential wealth. Lombardy and the Veneto were the most prosperous parts of Italy and that should be taken into consideration both for the remuneration composers would receive, the number of opera houses providing opportunities and the fact that composers follow the money as other studies have shown.",

      "abstract": "In today\u2019s world, the amount of available information is growing at an exponential rate, and it becomes more and more difficult to read, on any given topic, even if very specific and narrowly defined, whatever has been published, be it by publishers in subscribed periodicals or databases, in print materials or on the Web. TDM is, according to some, a growing and very promising economic sector. Its applications seem to be full of potentialities, in a whole range of sectors, from forensic investigation, to predictive marketing and scientific research in all kinds of sectors (be they commercial or not). At the same time, in today\u2019s world, most information becomes available in a digital format, either from its first creation or because of the growing digitization of existing print archives.\nResearch is more and more relying on data analysis techniques and, as the quantity of information grows, so does the need to be able to rely on data analysis, because computers and software will more and more have to be called upon to analyze quantities of materials which human beings will, for time and resources reasons, no more have the possibility to read and screen. Data analysis also offers the possibility to uncover new relationships between information and data which science had always been unaware of.\nFrom a legal point of view, data analysis raises various issues, one of the important one being probably privacy and personal data protection. This Study however concentrates only on intellectual property, and particularly copyright and database protection (sui generis right).\nA few countries in the world have adopted or are in the process of adopting specific copyright provisions to introduce a data analysis exception in their legislation. The purpose of this Study was to describe how data analysis fits within the present legal context in Europe (both in terms of copyright and of database protection), to highlight the issues which may constitute obstacles or difficulties when applying the existing legal texts, and to analyze whether a new exception for data analysis would be useful or necessary. The purpose was not to suggest ready-to-use provisions for a new possible directive but only to give directions and make suggestions.",

      "abstract": "The Study on the territoriality of the making available right assessed how to localize the act of making available to the public and its consequences on selected issues such as the rules of enforcement, the provisions on authorship, ownership and transfer of rights, and the impact of that relation with the reproduction right. The Study identified the existence of different acts of reproduction \u2013 upstream and downstream \u2013 in the process of the act of making available, that may complicate the licensing of works for online use and have an impact in terms of conflicts of laws in case of infringement. However, the Study observed that the InfoSoc Directive does not regulate the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Both rights are autonomous and can apply cumulatively, so that a single technical act may simultaneously fall under the making available and the right of reproduction, even if those rights are managed separately. In a second part, the Study analyzed two criteria that could help localizing the making available right (country of origin principle and place of the exploitation of the work) and assessed which consequences they would have on the selected topics. It showed that these localization criteria would not solve the bottlenecks found under the current state of law with regard to the reproduction right, as both the uploader and the end user having access to a work made available online would still face issues regarding the copies made in the course of the technological process used.\n\nThe present Study deepens the analysis of the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Considering acts of streaming and downloading, it examines whether the copies of works made through the technical process of making them available on the internet fall under the scope of art. 2 of the InfoSoc Directive, and whether these may be exempted under the exception for temporary copy or the exception for private copy provided by art. 5.",

The estimate obtained for optimal term (15 years) is far below the length of copyright in almost all jurisdictions. Furthermore, while an exact point estimate is obviously subject to considerable variation due to the uncertainty in the underlying parameters, the authors have confirmed using a variety of robustness checks that current copyrights are almost certainly too long. This implies that there is a significant role for policymakers to improve social welfare by reducing copyright term as well as indicating that existing terms should not be extended. Such a result is particularly important given the degree of recent debate on this exact topic. Policymakers could increase social welfare by decreasing current copyright term and definitely should not extend it.",

In Proposition 1 they derived a single, simple, equation that defined optimal term as a function of key exogenous variables. Using the estimates for these variables derived from the available empirical data they obtained a point estimate for optimal copyright term of approximately 15 years (with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years). To the authors' knowledge this is the first such estimate which is properly grounded, both theoretically and empirically.\n\n*The author created a model where he calculated the optimal copyright term in terms of dependent variables like \"cultural decay\" (which is the depreciation rate of cultural works), discount rate (interest rate), and proportion of available surplus that is deadweight loss, among others. \n\n* The author found that the copyright term was decreasing in all three variables so when cultural decay, discount rate, and or proportion of surplus that is deadweight loss increased; there was a decrease in optimal copyright term length. \n\n* The author stated that 15 years would be the optimal copyright term and that with 99.9% confidence could say that the optimal copyright term length was under 50 years and with 99% confidence under 38 years. \n\n* Thus concluded that the current copyright term length is too long and should be decreased in order to maximise social welfare.",

      "abstract": "The paper seeks to provide a discussion of the competition law issues raised by access to premium content (essentially blockbusters and football rights) by content delivery operators with a special emphasis on new media platforms. A significant amount of literature has been published on the application of competition rules to premium content rights agreements, but the specific obstacles encountered by new media platforms have been relatively unexplored. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature. \n\nThe European Commission (hereafter, the Commission) has recognised in its decisions that premium content is an \"essential input\" for operators active in the delivery of audio-visual content. There is indeed no substitution possible with other less attractive forms of content. In fact, premium content such as major football events represents \"stand-alone\" driver content for pay-TV operators. Absent access to such content it is very difficult for a content delivery operator to gain or retain market shares. Access to premium content is thus a matter of life or death for such operators. \n\nYet, getting access to premium content is not an easy matter. First, premium content is scarce as there are only a few blockbusters and a limited number of premium sport events every year. Moreover, premium content rights contracts usually involve some form of exclusivity pursuant to which dominant pay-TV operators often manage to monopolize such rights for several years at the expense of weaker competitors. The combination of scarcity and exclusivity has translated into a spiralling of the costs involved in buying premium content. For instance, while in 1992, broadcasters paid 434 million euros for the TV rights of the English Premier League, in 2000, they paid 2,6 billion euros for only three seasons. \n\nThe lack of access to premium content represents a significant handicap for new entrants, such as new media platforms. If these platforms want to gain market share, they need to show programmes, which are able to compete with the content shown by dominant pay-TV operators. Access foreclosure to premium content would thus not only prevent new entries from taking place in the highly concentrated pay-TV market, but would also affect technological developments and consumer choice as the latter would be prevented from watching their favourite programmes on the platform of their choice. Thus, in a number of policy speeches, Commission officials have insisted on the importance that new media platforms gain access to premium content. \n\nThe main argument followed throughout the paper is that, while recent Commission decisions contain remedies, which will help new media platforms to gain access to premium content, such remedies are insufficient to create a level playing field in the market for the acquisition of such content. Numerous anti-competitive practices continue to plague this market and further competition law intervention is thus required.",

The coefficient on rule of law is negative and statistically significant. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the legal system might act a deterrent factor of piracy behaviour, hence supporting previous findings (Holm, 2003).",

The regression results also reveal that the efficiency of the judicial system is an important factor when explaining cross-national variations in piracy rates. No significant association was found between\nincome, education and piracy rates. Overall, the results are in line with previous empirical research.",
