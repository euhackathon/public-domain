Project documentation was also made available, and this material takes two forms: policy documents which were circulated and updated as the project took place; and an internal report produced towards the end of the project, which includes a variety of statistics and more general lessons learned. \n\nThe report finds that while the initial risk management strategy adopted by the Wellcome has been successful, there is still very little evidence available about the success of rights clearance and risk management in the UK archive sector, and that further empirical investigation is required.",

They managed these risks in three ways.\nFirst: the publication of in-copyright material online was made possible using a risk management strategy which involves a set of risk criteria for identifying medium and high-risk rightsholders in the collections, and a diligent search standard for locating and contacting rightsholders.\nSecond: they managed the publication of potentially sensitive material online using their Access to Archives policy, which provides guidance that can be followed for all physical, digitised and born-digital material held across the Wellcome Library, to take into account both searchroom\nand online access to sensitive, personal data.\nThird: in addition to this, they have an established takedown policy which predates Codebreakers, and applies to all material available on their website. The most significant indicators of success for the archives clearance process include the number of permissions to publish granted: of the 77% of rightsholders contacted who responded, 98% said yes.
